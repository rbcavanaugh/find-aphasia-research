title: "About this Website"
---

This website was made on a whim. It's not very good yet. 

In the future, I hope that I can reduce the amount of text on the 'list of studies' page.

I'm also hoping that I might be able to get aphasia researchers to send me a youtube link
with an aphasia-friendly recruiting video that I can embed instead of the text altogether. 

Researchers could also tell me whether or not their study is being done remotely, or if they are reimbursing transportation costs and housing for participants and I could indicate this stuff on the map. 

This website was built with data from the [*clinicaltrials.gov*](https://clinicaltrials.gov/) API to pull studies that included a keyword or condition listing of Aphasia (and other information from clinicaltrials.gov). Then I filtered out studies that included primary progressive aphasia and other dementias (I could be convinced to change that...). Finally, I plotted the location information on a map using {highcharter} in R and learned some javascript to link the pins on the map to the correct section of the 'list of studies' page. The website was built using {distill} in R which is a quick way to generate static websites. 

I tried to include Canada (and international studies in general) but my map building skills are...a work in progress. So it just includes the USA for now.

Probably I should also change the URL. 

Please contact me or file an issue. See here: https://github.com/rbcavanaugh/find-aphasia-research
