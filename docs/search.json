Approximately one third of people who had a stroke live with a communication disorder, aphasia, which is associated with the largest negative relationship to quality of life. In chronic stages, people with aphasia (PwA) often do not receive any rehabilitation, despite treatment being shown to significantly reduce impairment. In contrast to existing computerized aphasia treatment, VoiceAdapt is an innovative and motivating application for PwA that provides adaptive and context-aware training lessons via speech interaction on the mobile device. A user-centred design process and motivational gamification ensure long-term engagement in training. Through providing an autonomously usable and low-cost tool, VoiceAdapt will positively affect PwA’s self-esteem and social inclusion, leading to higher quality of life.\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n\n\nbe at least 6 months post onset of a single stroke in the left hemisphere\n\nhave aphasia of mild to moderate severity (Aphasia Quotient ≥ 30 on WAB–R) with a prominent verbal expression impairment.\n\npass screenings of visual perception (BORB), hearing (pure tone screening with portable audiometer), and basic cognitive functioning (Raven’s Coloured Progressive Matrices)\n\nspeak English as a primary language.\n\nbe willing to commit to participation for study duration\nExlcusion Criteria:\n\n\nCurrently participating in individual (one-on-one) speech-language therapy\n\nContact Information:\n\n\nElizabeth Rochon, PhD\n\n\nPhone:\n\n\n780-248-1542\n\n\nEmail:\n\n\nesther.kim@ualberta.ca\n\n\nEsther S Kim, PhD\n\n\nPhone:\n\n\n416-978-8332\n\n\nEmail:\n\n\nElizabeth.Rochon@utoronto.ca\n\n\n\nHelp me write an email to Esther S Kim and Elizabeth Rochon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n  \n  Copy this email template into your email:\n  \n  Dear Alyssa Kelly,\n  I found your research on find-aphasia-research.org. \n  I have aphasia and I'm interested in learning more about the study.

It will do so by incorporating communication supports and compensatory speech-language treatment. The goal of developing this integrated treatment is to improve successful communication participation, psychosocial adjustment, and quality of life for stroke survivors with aphasia.\nIn the first phase of the project, the investigators will create a treatment manual with input from a stakeholder advisory board consisting of caregivers and stroke survivors with aphasia. The investigators will then recruit an initial cohort of five stroke survivors with aphasia to undergo the initial version of the treatment based and provide feedback. This will aid revision of the manual, which the investigators will then evaluate using a second cohort of 16 stroke survivors with aphasia. The investigators predict that ACT for Aphasia will be acceptable and feasible based on measures of participant satisfaction and treatment adherence. The investigators will also measure pre- to post-treatment changes in psychological distress, functional disability, quality of life, and communication participation and functioning to establish preliminary effect size estimates for this intervention, in preparation for a subsequent Stage II efficacy trial.\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n\n\nParticipants will be age 18 or older.\n\nParticipants will have an existing diagnosis of aphasia subsequent to left hemisphere stroke.\n\nParticipants will be within the first year after stroke onset.\nExlcusion Criteria:\n\n\nParticipants with a history of other acquired or progressive neurological disease.\n\nParticipants whose mean modality t-score falls below 40 on the spoken language comprehension subdomain of the Comprehensive Aphasia Test.\n\nParticipants with semantic memory impairments as determined by the cutoff of the semantic memory component of the Comprehensive Aphasia Test.\n\nParticipants with unmanaged drug /alcohol dependence.\n\nParticipants with severe diagnose.d mood or behavioral disorders that require specialized mental health interventions\n\nContact Information:\n\n\nAlyssa Kelly, MA\n\n\nPhone:\n\n\n412-383-6943\n\n\nEmail:\n\n\nANK155@pitt.edu\n\n\n\nHelp me write an email to Alyssa Kelly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n  \n  Copy this email template into your email:\n  \n  Dear Nadine Martin and Wendy Greenspan,\n  I found your research on find-aphasia-research.org. \n  I have aphasia and I'm interested in learning more about the study.

One common type of aphasia is known as non-fluent aphasia. Patients with non-fluent aphasia have difficulty formulating grammatical sentences, often producing short word fragments despite having a good understanding of what others are trying to communicate to them. Speech language pathologists (SLPs) play a central role rehabilitating persons with aphasia and administer therapy in an attempt to improve communication skills. Despite standard therapy, approximately 50% of individuals who experience aphasia acutely continue to have language deficits more than 6 months post-stroke.\nIn most people, Broca’s area is dominant in the left side of the brain. Following a left-sided stroke, the right-sided homologue of Broca’s area (the pars triangularis), may adopt language function. Unfortunately, reorganizing language to the right side of the brain seems to be less effective than restoring function to the left hemisphere. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), a form of non-invasive brain stimulation, can be used to suppress activity of specific regions in the right side of the brain to promote recovery of function in the perilesional area. Despite preliminary success in existing studies using rTMS in post-stroke aphasia, there is much work to be done to better understand the mechanisms underlying recovery. Responses to rTMS have been positive, yet heterogenous, which may be related to timing of treatments following stroke.\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n\n\nIsolated left middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke within past 3 months (sub-acute) or more than 6 months ago (chronic)\n\nStroke type: Ischemic or hemorrhagic\n\nNon-fluent aphasia as determined by the Western Aphasia Battery (Fluency < 5)\n\nRight-hand dominant prior to stroke\n\nEnglish is first or primary language\n\nAbility to follow 3-step commands\nExlcusion Criteria:\n\n\nPrior stroke to the right frontal lobe\n\nCurrent diagnosis of moderate to severe depression\n\nDiagnosis of any other psychiatric condition\n\nHistory of other neurologic disorders (e.g., epilepsy, brain tumor)\n\nContraindication to MRI or TMS (metal in the head or any implanted electrical device)\n\nHas received intensive speech therapy within the past 6 months (>8 hours per week)\n\nEnrolled in another interventional study\n\nContact Information:\n\n\nTrevor A Low, BSc\n\n\nPhone:\n\n\n4039448461\n\n\nEmail:\n\n\ntalow@ucalgary.ca\n\n\n\nHelp me write an email to Trevor A Low\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n  \n  Copy this email template into your email:\n  \n  Dear Leigh Ann Spell and Hanh Adkins,\n  I found your research on find-aphasia-research.org. \n  I have aphasia and I'm interested in learning more about the study.

The goal of this project is to evaluate the extent to which a novel treatment (T-WRITE) improves written language function and the use of text messaging; we also evaluate whether there are subsequent positive effects on the participant’s social connectedness and ultimately health-related quality of life (HRQOL).\nT-WRITE involves choral reading and repeated writing of sentences via texting. Participants work intensively and independently at home on a laptop computer. A virtual therapist directs the participant to practice copying and independently writing phrases and short sentences using the typing feature on a cellular phone. The specific objective of this randomized clinical trial is to compare T-WRITE to ORLA+WTG, a similar treatment that targets written expression using handwriting.\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n\n\ndiagnosis of an aphasia subsequent to a left-hemisphere infarct(s) that is confirmed by CT scan or MRI\n\nAphasia Quotient score on the Western Aphasia Battery-Revised of 40-85.\n\n> 6 months post injury\n\npremorbidly right handed, determined by Edinburgh Handedness Inventory\n\ncompleted at least an eighth grade education\n\npremorbid proficiency in English by self-report\nExlcusion Criteria:\n\n\nany other neurological condition (other than cerebral vascular disease) that could potentially affect cognition or speech, such as Parkinson’s Disease, Alzheimer’s Dementia, traumatic brain injury.\n\nactive substance abuse.\n\nContact Information:\n\n\nElissa Conlon, MA\n\n\nPhone:\n\n\n312-238-6163\n\n\nEmail:\n\n\neconlon@sralab.org\n\n\nLeora Cherney, PhD\n\n\nPhone:\n\n\n312-238-6163\n\n\nEmail:\n\n\nlcherney@sralab.org\n\n\n\nHelp me write an email to Elissa Conlon and Leora Cherney\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n  \n  Copy this email template into your email:\n  \n  Dear Kadir Kara and Funda Atamaz Calis,\n  I found your research on find-aphasia-research.org. \n  I have aphasia and I'm interested in learning more about the study.

One of the most debilitating types of aphasia is non-fluent aphasia. Non-fluent aphasia is defined by significantly reduced speech production, with the speaker producing only a few words or even less. Speech entrainment therapy (SET) is a treatment that has been shown to increase fluency in people with non-fluent aphasia. The study looks to define the best dose of SET that leads to sustained improvements in spontaneous speech production.\nParticipants who are eligible will undergo baseline language testing, an MRI, and will be randomized into one of 4 treatment groups: SET for 3 weeks, SET for 4.5 weeks, SET for 6 weeks, and no treatment (control group).\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n\n\nAphasia as a result of a left hemisphere ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke (WAB-R Aphasia quotient <93.8).\n\nPatients must have spoken English as their primary language.\n\n21-81 years old\n\npre-stroke modified Rankin Scale (mRS)= 2 or less,\n\npost-stroke mRS= 4 or less.\n\nAt least 6 months post-stroke.\n\nNon-fluent aphasia (WAB-R comprehension score >4 and WAB-R fluency score <6).\nExlcusion Criteria:\n\n\nHistory of chronic neurological or psychiatric diseases (excluding migraines, depression, or post-stroke epilepsy).

It will be a randomized, crossed over, interventional pilot study recruiting 54 patients with poststroke nonfluent aphasia. Patients will be treated individually in 40-minute sessions twice a week for 8 weeks. In each session, a speech therapist and an actor will select the clips with muted words or sentences that have been detected as functionally meaningful for each patient. Outcomes will be assessed as significant differences in two aphasia tests.\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n\n\nnonfluent aphasia due to unilateral stroke in the left hemisphere without neuroimaging evidence of lesions in the right hemisphere.\n\nthe patient should have received a standard program of conventional speech therapy after stroke, remaining with aphasia with the following characteristics: severely restricted language, poor repetition (even for single words), not exceeding the 70th percentile in the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination (BDAE) for repetition. Moderately preserved language comprehension: listening comprehension exceeding the 15th percentile of BDAE (average score obtained in three areas: word comprehension, commands and complex ideational material).\n\nSigned informed consent.\nExlcusion Criteria:\n\n\nAny clinical condition (short life expectancy, coexisting disease) or other characteristics that precluded appropriate follow-up.\n\nParticipation in any therapeutic trial evaluating poststroke recovery.\n\nContact Information:\n\n\nBlanca Fuentes Gimeno\n\n\nPhone:\n\n\n917277444\n\n\nEmail:\n\n\nblanca.fuentes@salud.madrid.org\n\n\nElena de Celis Ruiz\n\n\nPhone:\n\n\n917277444\n\n\nEmail:\n\n\nelena.decelis.ruiz@idipaz.es\n\n\n\nHelp me write an email to Blanca Fuentes Gimeno and Elena de Celis Ruiz\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n  \n  Copy this email template into your email:\n  \n  Dear Chaleece W Sandberg,\n  I found your research on find-aphasia-research.org. \n  I have aphasia and I'm interested in learning more about the study.

Word-finding in conversation is a universal and persistent difficulty in aphasia. While several techniques exist to improve word-finding in aphasia, it is unclear how the brain changes in response to behavioral therapy. In this study, persons with aphasia will receive behavioral therapy aimed at helping them to be more successful at finding words. Twenty therapy sessions will be provided in a 10-week period. Each therapy session will last about 2 hours and will include a variety of language tasks. Prior to beginning word-finding therapy, each participant will receive two fMRI scans, spaced 10 weeks apart. After finishing therapy, each participant will receive two additional fMRI scans, spaced 10 weeks apart. For a portion of the MRI scan, participants will complete language tasks. The purpose of these fMRI scans is to measure brain changes that may occur due to successful behavioral therapy. The hypotheses are as follows: First, that the behavioral therapy will improve word-finding as it has been shown to do in the past. Second, that the brain will change in a couple of different ways. It is expected that the network of regions that support word-finding will be more connected and work together more efficiently after therapy. It is also expected that the networks of regions that support other aspects of cognitive function, such as attention and executive function, will also be more connected and work together more efficiently.\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n\n\nDiagnosis of aphasia\n\nSustained stroke more than 6 months prior to consent\n\nRight-handed\n\nNative speakers of English\n\nCompleted at least a high school education\n\nNormal or corrected-to-normal vision and hearing\n\nProvide written informed consent\n\nParticipants will be medically stable and at least wheelchair ambulatory at the time of participation with uncompromised use of the left hand\nExlcusion Criteria:\n\n\nHistory of degenerative neurological disorders (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease), acquired neurological disorders other than aphasia from stroke (e.g., traumatic brain injury), developmental neurological disorders (e.g., autism), or psychiatric disorders\n\nAn active medical condition that could compromise participation (e.g., cancer undergoing acute treatment)\n\nNot safe to enter the bore of the magnet (e.g., pacemaker)\n\nTaking medications that are known to exert significant effects on cognitive processes\n\nPregnancy or possibility of pregnancy\n\nDo not meet the above inclusionary criteria\n\nContact Information:\n\n\nChaleece W Sandberg, Ph.D.\n\n\nPhone:\n\n\n8148632006\n\n\nEmail:\n\n\ncws18@psu.edu\n\n\n\nHelp me write an email to Chaleece W Sandberg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n  \n  Copy this email template into your email:\n  \n  Dear Andrew Olson,\n  I found your research on find-aphasia-research.org. \n  I have aphasia and I'm interested in learning more about the study.

This often devastating condition is treated by speech and language therapists (SLTs). There is evidence that language games delivered at the right intensity are an efficacious means of improving communication for people with post stroke aphasia. However, it is unclear which mechanism of language facilitation used in a game works best. This study will provide evidence for the “active ingredient” of a game, together with measures of efficacy, feasibility and enjoyment compared to standard aphasia therapy.\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n\n\nAdults who have suffered a stroke a minimum of 2 months prior to commencement of the intervention.

Branch Coslett\n\n\nInstitution: University of Pennsylvania\n\n\nCountry: United States\n\n\nCity: Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\n\nBrief Description:\n\nTranscranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) has been demonstrated to improve language function in subjects with chronic aphasia in a number of small studies, many of which did not include a control group. Although the treatment appears promising, data to date do not permit an adequate assessment of the utility of the technique. The investigators propose to study the effects of TMS combined with Constraint Induced Language Therapy (CILT) in 75 subjects with chronic aphasia. Subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to TMS with CILT or sham TMS with CILT. One Hz TMS at 90% motor threshold will be delivered to the right inferior frontal gyrus for 20 minutes in 10 sessions over 2 weeks; language therapy will be provided for one hour immediately after the conclusion of each session of TMS. Change from baseline in the Western Aphasia Battery Aphasia Quotient at 6 months after the end of TMS treatment will serve as the primary outcome measure. A secondary aim is to identify anatomic and behavioral predictors of response to treatment. Finally, a third aim is to identify the mechanism underlying the beneficial effect of the treatment using a variety of imaging techniques. Subjects who have no contraindication to the MRI will undergo fMRI imaging prior to and at 6 months after therapy. Using modern network analyses and robust machine learning techniques, the investigators will identify changes in the strengths of connections between nodes in the language network to address specific hypotheses regarding the effects of TMS and CILT on brain organization that are associated with beneficial response to treatment.\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n\n\nClinical evidence and MRI or CT verification of a single left hemisphere stroke with moderate to severe aphasia.\n\nSuffered their stroke at least 6 months prior to their testing\n\nMust be able to understand the nature of the study, and give informed consent\nExlcusion Criteria:\n\n\nMultiple strokes (excluding small lacunar strokes) as defined by brain imaging\n\nHistory of substance abuse\n\nPrevious head trauma with loss of consciousness for more than 5 minutes\n\nPsychiatric illness (We note that subjects will be assessed with the 15-item Geriatric Depression scale.

Speech and language therapy can help people recover their language ability, but often requires months or even years of therapy before a person is able to overcome these challenges. This research will investigate non-invasive brain stimulation as a way to enhance the effects of speech and language therapy, which may ultimately lead to better and faster recovery from stroke and aphasia. The investigators hypothesize that participants with aphasia who receive speech and language therapy paired with active electrical brain stimulation will improve significantly more on a language comprehension task than those who receive speech and language therapy paired with sham stimulation.\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n\n\n18 years or older.\n\nNo diagnosis of neurological disorder (other than stroke).\n\nNo diagnosis of psychiatric disorder.\n\nNo seizure within the past 6 months.\n\nNot pregnant.\n\nIn chronic phase of recovery, defined as at least 6 months post-stroke.\n\nNot undergoing speech and language therapy targeting auditory comprehension or attention for the duration of the study.\n\nNo metal implants in the head.\n\nNo unhealed skull fractures.\n\nOnset of aphasia related to left hemisphere stroke.\n\nDamaged brain tissue from stroke does not overlap with left hemisphere dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.\n\nMild to moderate aphasia.\n\nCognitive ability minimally within functional limits.\n\nAble to pass vision and hearing screening (with use of corrective aids if needed; eyeglasses, hearing aids).\n\nWilling to allow audio-recording of study sessions.\nExlcusion Criteria:\n\n\nYounger than 18 years old.\n\nDiagnosis or history of neurological disorder other than stroke.\n\nDiagnosis or history of psychiatric disorder.\n\nHistory of seizures within the past 6 months.\n\nPregnant.\n\n<6 months post-stroke (however, if this is only exclusionary criterion met, participant can be re-evaluated at the 6-month mark if still interested in the study)\n\nCurrently undergoing speech and language therapy targeting auditory comprehension or attention.\n\nMetal implants in the head.\n\nCurrently has a skull fracture.\n\nOnset of aphasia related to etiology other than left hemisphere stroke.\n\nDamaged brain tissue includes left hemisphere dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.\n\nNo aphasia or severe aphasia.\n\nCognitive ability below functional limits.\n\nUnable to pass vision and/or hearing screening with use of corrective aids.\n\nUnwilling to allow audio-recording of study sessions.\n\nContact Information:\n\n\nEllyn A Riley, PHD\n\n\nPhone:\n\n\n315-443-9621\n\n\nEmail:\n\n\nearil100@syr.edu\n\n\n\nHelp me write an email to Ellyn A Riley\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n  \n  Copy this email template into your email:\n  \n  Dear Leora Cherney and Sameer Ashaie,\n  I found your research on find-aphasia-research.org. \n  I have aphasia and I'm interested in learning more about the study.

Aphasia impacts language production and comprehension as well as reading and writing. The ramifications of aphasia extend beyond language impairment to negatively impacting a person’s social, vocational, and recreational activities. Currently, the most effective way to treat aphasia is with speech-language therapy (SLT). However, even if SLT is intensive, persons with aphasia are left with residual language delays. Recent research suggests that pairing SLT with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) a non-invasive, safe, low-cost form of brain stimulation may aid language recovery in persons with aphasia. However, results from tDCS studies are inconclusive. The success of tDCS in combination with SLT could depend on the timing of tDCS since tDCS-induced effects depend on the neuronal state of the brain-networks at the time of the stimulation. In this study, the differential impact of tDCS before behavioral SLT (offline-before therapy), tDCS after SLT (offline-after therapy), and tDCS concurrently with SLT (online) on functional language recovery in persons with aphasia will be investigated. Sham tDCS (i.e., SLT alone) as a control group will also be included in the study. The investigators hypothesize that both offline and online tDCS will improve language functioning than sham tDCS.\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n\n\nMen or women with diagnosis of fluent or non-fluent aphasia subsequent to a left-hemisphere infarct(s) that is confirmed by a MRI or CT scan\n\nAphasia quotient on the WAB of 35-80\n\nAt least 6 months post onset of aphasia (this is beyond the stage of spontaneous recovery)\n\n18- 80 years of age\n\nPremorbidly fluent in English\n\nPremorbidly right-hand dominant per the Edinburg Handedness Inventory\n\nVisual acuity of 20/40 corrected\n\nAuditory acuity no worse than 30 dB HL on pure tone testing, aided in the better ear.\n\nEducation greater than 12th grade\nExlcusion Criteria:\n\n\nAny other neurological condition (other than cerebral vascular disease) that could impact language and cognition such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, primary progressive aphasia, and traumatic brain injury\n\nActive substance use\n\nIndividuals with epilepsy\n\nContact Information:\n\n\nLeora Cherney, PhD\n\n\nPhone:\n\n\n312-238-1117\n\n\nEmail:\n\n\nlcherney@sralab.org\n\n\nSameer Ashaie, PhD\n\n\nPhone:\n\n\n312-238-6163\n\n\nEmail:\n\n\nsameer.ashaie@northwestern.edu\n\n\n\nHelp me write an email to Leora Cherney and Sameer Ashaie\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n  \n  Copy this email template into your email:\n  \n  Dear Sylvie Moritz-Gasser,\n  I found your research on find-aphasia-research.org. \n  I have aphasia and I'm interested in learning more about the study.

Recent studies suggest that chronic stroke patients benefit from SLT with high frequency and that cognitive abilities can play a role in sentence comprehension and production by individuals with aphasia. To investigate the effects of the distribution of training time for teleSLT and teleCT the investigators use two combinations. In the experimental group 80% of the training time will be devoted to teleSLT and 20% to teleCT whereas in the control group 20% of the training time will be devoted to teleSLT and 80% to teleCT. Both groups receive the same total amount and frequency of intervention but with different distributions.

Subjects and assessors will be blinded to the condition making the experiment double blind. Specifically, subjects will be told that we are exploring a new therapy that using different sounds to improve therapy. Parallel group design will ensure that subjects in the Control group are unaware that their “sounds” are softer than the START group. Trainers may become aware that a loud sound is present thus a unique Assessor will evaluate clinical performance before and after training making the study double-blind. Fifty-four subjects will undergo baseline testing in the laboratory to establish their capacity for functional and expressive speech as well as their self-reported health-related quality of life (power analysis below). Next, subjects will participate in a high-frequency, word-picture verification/ auditory-repetition treatment, 2 hr/day for 5 consecutive days focusing on expression of words of functional significance (e.g., water, fall). Subjects will either receive training with START or without (Control). Subjects will be re-tested immediately following training as well as one-month post to assess retention. Aim 1 will evaluate capacity of START to enhance SLT outcomes by assessing the % change in clinical assessment of functional and expressive speech. Our preliminary data points to a robust response [details]. Aim 2 will focus on the capacity of these changes to 1) be retained and 2) impact subject’s reported quality of life. NOTE: While we are planning in-person baseline, end, and retention testing, in response to COVID, we have established remote clinical screening using peer-reviewed validated techniques for WAB and ABA-2 (see Alternative Solutions). All preliminary data collected for this proposal were collected remotely via no-contact protocols.\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n\n\n18 years old\n\nNative English Speakers\n\nCapacity to provide informed consent\n\nRight-handed\n\nCorrected to normal vision\n\nLeft hemisphere cerebral stroke at least 6 months prior to testing\n\nPresence of severe-to-moderate, non-fluent aphasia, i.e. Aphasia Quotients of 0-50 on the Western Aphasia Battery-Revised (PsychCorp, 2007)\n\nCorrected pure tone threshold (octave frequencies 250- 4000 Hz) norms for their age and gender41,42 NOTE: Audiometry data will be collected for all participants by lab personnel trained by an audiologist in a sound-attenuated booth.

Nevertheless, the efficacy of synchronous rTMS protocol integrated with computer-integrated speech training is not well understood. It is also not clear regarding the efficacy of compound bi-hemispheric stimulation protocol. The aim of the study is to investigate language response to these new strategies and to determine the longevity of the therapeutic outcome. Advanced MR neuroimaging techniques, such as fMRI and DTI, are powerful tools to evaluate the concomitant nervous changes after rTMS treatment on aphasic patients. The knowledge from fMRI and DTI microstructural evolution provides insight into underlined mechanism operating the language improvement.\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n\n\nAphasic stroke in chronic stage (over 3 months)\nExlcusion Criteria:\n\n\nNo seizure history, no brain surgery history, no electronic device in brain or chest, no dementia\n\nContact Information:\n\n\nPo-Yi Tsai, MD\n\n\nPhone:\n\n\n886-228757293\n\n\nEmail:\n\n\npytsai@vghtpe.gov.tw\n\n\n\nHelp me write an email to Po-Yi Tsai\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n  \n  Copy this email template into your email:\n  \n  Dear Elena V Donoso Brown,\n  I found your research on find-aphasia-research.org. \n  I have aphasia and I'm interested in learning more about the study.

Each stroke survivor has a unique pattern of strengths and weaknesses in communication and cognition, and a unique course of recovery. The BUILD study aims to understand the brain basis of these individual differences in stroke outcome. Participants with stroke as well as controls matched in age, educational background, race, and sex are examined using a combination of standardized and in-house tests of language and cognition to provide a detailed profile of strengths and weaknesses. Each participant will have between three and six sessions, including an MRI to measure details of the structure, function, and connections in the brain. The data are analyzed to test how patterns in the stroke lesion explain the patterns of communication and cognitive difficulties, and how patterns in the uninjured parts of the brain explain resilience and recovery from the stroke.

Spatial-motor-sensory problems limit functioning and independence, which is costly to Veterans, their families, and society. Currently, spatial-motor-sensory problems are targeted using different treatments. However, there is a treatment that has shown promise in simultaneously targeting spatial function, motor function and pain in right-brain stroke. The investigators propose to investigate the feasibility of using adapted spatial-motor sensory assessment and treatment procedures for Veterans with left-brain stroke who have language and cognitive impairment. The next step will be to conduct a large-scale study focused on this multi-target treatment for more efficient and effective stroke rehabilitation. The investigators expect this line of research to increase functioning, independence and quality of life in Veteran stroke survivors.\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n\n\n1-3 months post-stroke, entering outpatient treatment\n\nproficient English speakers\n\nexperiencing moderate functional disability as measured by Functional Independence Measure (FIM), observational or telephone-administered FONE-FIM\n\nexperiencing aphasia as determined by a Western Aphasia Battery Aphasia Quotient and memory impairment as determined by the Brief Visuospatial Memory Test- Revised, the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test- Revised or digit span forward and backward\n\nable to provide informed consent to participate, using aphasia-accessible process, as needed.\nExlcusion Criteria:\n\n\nHistory of brain conditions other than left brain stroke, including clinical right brain pathology.\n\nContact Information:\n\n\nAmy D Rodriguez, PhD\n\n\nPhone:\n\n\n321-6111\n\n\nEmail:\n\n\namy.rodriguez@va.gov\n\n\nLaura Britan Lang, MPH\n\n\nPhone:\n\n\n321-6111\n\n\nEmail:\n\n\nLaura.Britan_Lang@va.gov\n\n\n\nHelp me write an email to Amy D Rodriguez and Laura Britan Lang\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n  \n  Copy this email template into your email:\n  \n  Dear Aubrey S.

The investigators are also studying how inflammation is related to the symptoms that first occur in patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). For this reason, the investigators are asking people with different versions of Alzheimer’s disease to participate. This includes patients with either:\nPosterior cortical atrophy - a version of Alzheimer’s disease with vision difficulties Logopenic variant primary progressive aphasia - a version of Alzheimer’s disease with language difficulties Amnestic Alzheimer’s disease - a “typical” version of Alzheimer’s disease with memory difficulties The investigators are also enrolling older adults with normal visual, language, and memory function.\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n\n\nAge 50 to 75 years at time of screening.\n\nAt screening, must have no cognitive impairment, or meet criteria for amnestic Alzheimer’s disease, posterior cortical atrophy, or logopenic variant primary progressive aphasia. Diagnoses will be made based on history, exam, neuropsychological testing, brain MRI, and consensus diagnosis.\n\nPatients must have Clinical Dementia Rating scale score of 0.5 or 1 at enrollment. Controls must have Clinical Dementia Rating scale score of 0 at enrollment.\n\nSubjects unable to provide informed consent must have a surrogate decision maker.\n\nWritten and oral fluency in English.\n\nAble to participate in all scheduled evaluations and to complete all required tests and procedures.\n\nIn the opinion of the PI, the subject must be considered likely to comply with the study protocol and to have a high probability of completing the study.\nExlcusion Criteria:\n\n\nPast or present history of a brain disorder other than Alzheimer’s disease (including presence of cortical infarct on MRI even in absence of clinical stroke).\n\nSerious medical conditions, which make study procedures of the current study unsafe. Such serious medical conditions include uncontrolled epilepsy and multiple serious injuries.\n\nContraindication to MRI scanning.\n\nConditions precluding entry into the scanners (e.g. morbid obesity, claustrophobia, etc.).\n\nExposure to research related radiation in the past year that, when combined with this study, would place subjects above the allowable limits.\n\nParticipation in the last year in a clinical trial for a disease modifying drug for AD.\n\nTaking immunosuppressive medication (e.g., glucocorticoids, cytostatics, antibodies, drugs acting on immunophilins, interferons, tumor necrosis factor inhibitors). Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are not exclusionary.\n\nContact Information:\n\n\nAubrey S.
