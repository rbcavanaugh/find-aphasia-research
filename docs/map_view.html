Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for Stroke Survivors With Aphasia","Condition":"Stroke Aphasia","StartDate":"October 1, 2021","name":"NCT04984239","OrgFullName":"University of Pittsburgh","BriefSummary":"The proposed study is a Stage I successive cohort trial intended to adapt Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) to meet the specific needs of stroke survivors with aphasia (\"ACT for Aphasia\"). It will do so by incorporating communication supports and compensatory speech-language treatment. The goal of developing this integrated treatment is to improve successful communication participation, psychosocial adjustment, and quality of life for stroke survivors with aphasia.\n\nIn the first phase of the project, the investigators will create a treatment manual with input from a stakeholder advisory board consisting of caregivers and stroke survivors with aphasia. The investigators will then recruit an initial cohort of five stroke survivors with aphasia to undergo the initial version of the treatment based and provide feedback. This will aid revision of the manual, which the investigators will then evaluate using a second cohort of 16 stroke survivors with aphasia. The investigators predict that ACT for Aphasia will be acceptable and feasible based on measures of participant satisfaction and treatment adherence. The investigators will also measure pre- to post-treatment changes in psychological distress, functional disability, quality of life, and communication participation and functioning to establish preliminary effect size estimates for this intervention, in preparation for a subsequent Stage II efficacy trial.","DetailedDescription":"The overarching goals of this research are to improve psychosocial adjustment, quality of life, and successful communication participation by developing Act for Aphasia, a patient-centered, manualized behavioral intervention in Stage I research. Stroke survivors with aphasia in their first year post stroke will complete a 10-session intervention. In study Aim 1, the investigators will engage a Stakeholder Advisory Board (SAB) of people with aphasia (PWA) and caregivers to provide input to develop a treatment manual. The investigators will then use an iterative design process and two successive participant cohorts to refine the manual. Cohort 1 (N=5) will participate in the initial version of the treatment, then help inform its revision by being invited to join the SAB. Cohort 2 (N=16) will participate in the revised version. In Aim 2a the investigators will establish feasibility and acceptability of this intervention. In Aim 2b the investigators will estimate preliminary effect sizes for a subsequent Stage II efficacy trial.\n\nParticipant assignment: given the early phase of this research and the lack of control conditions or groups, there will be no random assignment. Participants will be enrolled in the study as they are referred and found to be eligible, with the first five participants being enrolled in the first study cohort during year 1 while the remainder of participants will be enrolled in the second cohort across years 1 and 2.\n\nIntervention description: the ACT for Aphasia treatment manual will be a 10-session intervention created by modifying an existing ACT manual provided by Dr. Meyer. To meet the specific needs of stroke survivors with aphasia, ACT will be modified in two main ways. First, the intervention will include modified language and communication supports to address the unique communication challenges faced by people with aphasia that could impede engagement with ACT content. Multi-modality communication supports will be provided by the treating clinician (e.g., writing out key words to support verbal content, summarizing and providing repetitions, providing session summaries to review between sessions). Manual creation will follow existing practice recommendations for modifying counseling interventions for PWA (e.g., simplifying language and increasing use of visual metaphors) which will be reviewed by the SAB. Second, ACT will be further augmented via individualized language compensation training and a focus on identifying and addressing communication-based barriers to life participation. Language training will focus on active compensatory strategies such as self-cuing, use of alternative modalities (gesture, writing), and use of commonly available technology (e.g., smartphone dictionaries, text-to-speech). The details of this language compensation training will also be determined based on input from the SAB, and will be revised after reviewing performance and interview feedback from each successive cohort.\n\nIntervention administration procedures: all aspects of the treatment protocol will be administered by Dr. Evans or a licensed speech-language pathologist on study staff who has received training in providing ACT.

Word-finding in conversation is a universal and persistent difficulty in aphasia. While several techniques exist to improve word-finding in aphasia, it is unclear how the brain changes in response to behavioral therapy. In this study, persons with aphasia will receive behavioral therapy aimed at helping them to be more successful at finding words. Twenty therapy sessions will be provided in a 10-week period. Each therapy session will last about 2 hours and will include a variety of language tasks. Prior to beginning word-finding therapy, each participant will receive two fMRI scans, spaced 10 weeks apart. After finishing therapy, each participant will receive two additional fMRI scans, spaced 10 weeks apart. For a portion of the MRI scan, participants will complete language tasks. The purpose of these fMRI scans is to measure brain changes that may occur due to successful behavioral therapy. The hypotheses are as follows: First, that the behavioral therapy will improve word-finding as it has been shown to do in the past. Second, that the brain will change in a couple of different ways. It is expected that the network of regions that support word-finding will be more connected and work together more efficiently after therapy. It is also expected that the networks of regions that support other aspects of cognitive function, such as attention and executive function, will also be more connected and work together more efficiently.","DetailedDescription":null,"Keyword":"aphasia treatment therapy anomia fMRI neuroimaging semantics","StudyType":"Interventional","EligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\nDiagnosis of aphasia\nSustained stroke more than 6 months prior to consent\nRight-handed\nNative speakers of English\nCompleted at least a high school education\nNormal or corrected-to-normal vision and hearing\nProvide written informed consent\nParticipants will be medically stable and at least wheelchair ambulatory at the time of participation with uncompromised use of the left hand\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nHistory of degenerative neurological disorders (e.g., Alzheimer's disease), acquired neurological disorders other than aphasia from stroke (e.g., traumatic brain injury), developmental neurological disorders (e.g., autism), or psychiatric disorders\nAn active medical condition that could compromise participation (e.g., cancer undergoing acute treatment)\nNot safe to enter the bore of the magnet (e.g., pacemaker)\nTaking medications that are known to exert significant effects on cognitive processes\nPregnancy or possibility of pregnancy\nDo not meet the above inclusionary criteria","HealthyVolunteers":"No","MinimumAge":null,"Gender":"All","LocationCity":"Hershey","LocationState":"Pennsylvania","lon":-76.6502468,"lat":40.2859239,"z":1,"link":"https://rbcavanaugh.github.io/find-aphasia-research/list_View/NCT03550092","location":"online"},{"BriefTitle":"Semantic Feature Analysis Treatment for Aphasia","Condition":"Aphasia","StartDate":"February 24, 2020","name":"NCT04215952","OrgFullName":"VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System","BriefSummary":"This randomized controlled comparative effectiveness study examines manipulation of a key component of an established and efficacious treatment for naming impairments in aphasia, along with cognitive and brain correlates of treatment success.

Although the treatment appears promising, data to date do not permit an adequate assessment of the utility of the technique. The investigators propose to study the effects of TMS combined with Constraint Induced Language Therapy (CILT) in 75 subjects with chronic aphasia. Subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to TMS with CILT or sham TMS with CILT. One Hz TMS at 90% motor threshold will be delivered to the right inferior frontal gyrus for 20 minutes in 10 sessions over 2 weeks; language therapy will be provided for one hour immediately after the conclusion of each session of TMS. Change from baseline in the Western Aphasia Battery Aphasia Quotient at 6 months after the end of TMS treatment will serve as the primary outcome measure. A secondary aim is to identify anatomic and behavioral predictors of response to treatment. Finally, a third aim is to identify the mechanism underlying the beneficial effect of the treatment using a variety of imaging techniques. Subjects who have no contraindication to the MRI will undergo fMRI imaging prior to and at 6 months after therapy. Using modern network analyses and robust machine learning techniques, the investigators will identify changes in the strengths of connections between nodes in the language network to address specific hypotheses regarding the effects of TMS and CILT on brain organization that are associated with beneficial response to treatment.","DetailedDescription":"TMS is a technique by which a brief electrical current is induced in brain tissue causing a brief suppression of the excitability of the underlying tissue; the technique, which was introduced in the 1980s and has been extensively used around the world, has been shown to transiently improve or disrupt specific cognitive operations. To achieve this end, a coil is positioned against the subject's head. The delivery of a single pulse begins with the discharge of current from a capacitor into a circular or figure-of-eight coil; this electrical current generates a brief magnetic field of up to 2.2 Tesla. As the pulse of electricity has a rise time of 0.2 ms. and a duration of 1 ms., the magnetic field changes in intensity quite rapidly. Because the magnetic field passes freely through the scalp, skull, and meninges, the flux in the magnetic field induces a small electric field in the brain that transiently alters neural activity.\n\nTMS may be delivered in a variety of ways. The investigators propose to use 1 Hz TMS; that is, TMS pulses will be delivered at a frequency of 1/second. This style of TMS is assumed to be inhibitory in that it transiently suppresses the function of the cortex under the coil. Using the figure-of-eight coil to be employed here, TMS is thought to reduce activity in approximately 1 cubic cm. of cortex. Many investigators have employed TMS with a frequency of 1 Hz for periods of 20 minutes and longer; mild behavioral deficits are often present for several minutes in these studies.\n\nThe baseline phase will consist of 3 sessions, each lasting 1-2 hours depending on the stamina of the subject. The point of the baseline testing is to characterize the subject's language function. To that end, a number of standard language and neuropsychological tasks will be administered. These include the Western Aphasia Battery, Pyramids and Palm Trees test, Figural Fluency Test, word and non-word repetition tasks, the Nicholas and Brookshire Narratives, CILT stimulus naming, and Northwestern Assessment of Verbs and Sentences. Additionally, during the baseline, subjects will undergo MRI of the brain or, if they have a contraindication to MRI, a CAT scan of the head. No contrast will be used.\n\nIn the treatment phase, there will be 10 TMS sessions over 2 consecutive weeks in which 20 minutes (1200 pulses) of 1 Hz TMS at 90% motor threshold will be delivered to the inferior pars triangularis. Each TMS treatment session will be immediately followed by a 60-90 minute session of CILT\n\nThere will be two 3-month post-treatment visits and two 6-month post-treatment visits in which the full battery of language and cognitive assessments will be repeated. Subjects who are able to undergo MRI scanning will have anatomic and fMRI scans at the first 6-month post-treatment visit.\n\nThe investigators will pair TMS with CILT which has been shown to have positive outcomes in post-stroke aphasia. CILT invokes use-dependent learning in communicative interactions by requiring spoken output and restricting use of alternative forms of communication, such as gestures. The investigators will use a dual card-matching task modeled after Maher et al. As in the original CILT design, the participant interacts verbally with a conversational partner (here, the speech language pathologist), in turn requesting a card of given description and complying with the partner's request. In this way, the treatment targets both production and comprehension. Moreover, as verbal targets increase in linguistic complexity across the protocol (\"a ball\", \"throw a ball\"; \"Do you have a ball\"?), a variety of lexical and phrasal structures are targeted. Studies of CILT have reported gains on multiple language behaviors, supporting its broad engagement of the language network.","Keyword":"","StudyType":"Interventional","EligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\nClinical evidence and MRI or CT verification of a single left hemisphere stroke with moderate to severe aphasia.\nSuffered their stroke at least 6 months prior to their testing\nMust be able to understand the nature of the study, and give informed consent\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nMultiple strokes (excluding small lacunar strokes) as defined by brain imaging\nHistory of substance abuse\nPrevious head trauma with loss of consciousness for more than 5 minutes\nPsychiatric illness (We note that subjects will be assessed with the 15-item Geriatric Depression scale.

Using a computer based speech and language therapy program, participants will practice conversational scripts that are either short or long. Participants will practice for either 2 weeks (5 days a week) or for 5 weeks (2 days a week).","DetailedDescription":"Determining the optimal intensity of treatment is essential to the design and implementation of any treatment program for aphasia. Yet, treatment intensity is a complex construct and information on the variables modulating it remain ambiguous and limited. Studies reported in the neuroscience and clinical literature support the need for intensive treatment to induce long-term neuroplastic changes while the cognitive psychology literature suggests that learning is best maintained with distributed schedules. A few studies have looked at dose parameters for single word naming tasks, but there is limited evidence regarding dose parameters for treatments that focus on training the production of larger units, such as sentences or even connected discourse. One approach that is frequently used clinically and has evidence for its efficacy is script training. Little is currently known regarding the optimum dose of script training (i.e., the number of repetitions over time of each sentence within the script) that is required to promote the best outcomes.\n\nThis study investigates the effects of modulating stimulus variables, specifically stimulus practice distribution and stimulus repetition. We use a baseline script treatment that has experimental support regarding its efficacy, and that allows the manipulation of these variables. To ensure independence and fidelity, treatment is provided in a controlled computer environment (desktop and tablet). To avoid clinician-related variables such as expertise and personality factors that may influence treatment, sentences are modeled during treatment by an anthropomorphic agent with high visual speech intelligibility and affective expressions.\n\nWith regard to \"best outcomes\", generalization is the ultimate goal of any treatment approach. Therefore, the primary outcome is a generalization measure of conversation. Secondary measures address short-term acquisition, longer-term maintenance, and stimulus and response generalization for assessing gain over baseline, differential effects, and interactions. A mobile-connected wireless wearable laryngeal sensor allows tracking of talk time at home and in the community as a measure of treatment effectiveness and transfer. For privacy, it does not record audio.\n\nResults and computational models of learning (generalization, short-term acquisition, and longer-term maintenance) will contribute new evidence to fill critical gaps in current scientific understanding regarding the effectiveness and clinical application of aphasia treatment approaches. More generally, findings will help to inform clinical practice and treatment of neurologic communication disorders; the virtual clinician guided intervention that the proposal develops has the potential to reduce costly clinician-client time otherwise required for long-term rehabilitation.","Keyword":"Stroke Speech and Language Therapy Speech and Language Treatment Communication Disorders Language Disorders","StudyType":"Interventional","EligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\nMen or women with diagnosis of aphasia\nLeft-hemisphere stroke\nAphasia Quotient score between 40-80 on the Western Aphasia Battery-Revised\nAt least 6 months post stroke\nCompleted at least eighth grade education\nPremorbidly literate in English\nVisual acuity no worse than 20/100 corrected in the better eye\nAuditory acuity no worse than 30 dB HL on pure tone testing, aided in better ear\nNot receiving speech-language therapy at the time of study\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nAny other neurological condition (other than cerebral vascular disease) that could potentially affect cognition or speech, such as Parkinson's Disease, Alzheimer's Dementia, traumatic brain injury\nAny significant psychiatric history prior to the stroke, such as severe major depression or psychotic disorder requiring hospitalization; subjects with mood disorders who are currently stable on treatment will be considered\nActive substance abuse","HealthyVolunteers":"No","MinimumAge":"21 Years","Gender":"All","LocationCity":"Chicago","LocationState":"Illinois","lon":-87.6297982,"lat":41.8781136,"z":1,"link":"https://rbcavanaugh.github.io/find-aphasia-research/list_View/NCT04138940","location":"online"},{"BriefTitle":"Improving Aphasia Using Electrical Brain Stimulation","Condition":"Stroke Aphasia","StartDate":"July 12, 2021","name":"NCT04963803","OrgFullName":"Syracuse University","BriefSummary":"Language and communication are essential for almost every aspect of human life, but for people who have aphasia, a language processing disorder that can occur after stroke or brain injury, even simple conversations can become a formidable challenge.

While language rehabilitation can yield improved language functioning, treatment outcomes vary greatly across individuals. In chronic aphasia, language gains occur through the brain's inherent ability to reorganize (i.e., neuroplasticity).\n\nWhile Speech-language therapy (SLT) can target various language skills and modalities, the most pervasive deficit across all persons with aphasia (PWA) is difficulty with word finding. Thus, aphasia treatment often includes some form of intervention focused on improving naming abilities. As with language function in general, naming abilities in PWA seems to be associated with left hemisphere recruitment, particularly with the viable tissue at the rim of the lesion (perilesional areas).

Approximately 180,000 new cases of aphasia are identified per year, and approximately 1 million or 1 in 250 are living with aphasia in the United States (NIH-NIDCD, 2015). Treatments are limited and provide modest benefits at best. The current emphasis in aphasia rehabilitation is to formulate intensive speech and language therapies and augment therapeutic benefits by providing brain stimulation concurrent with therapies. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is one of the most widely used such technique. While tDCS has had relative success in chronic aphasia (>6 months after stroke), it has not been efficacious during subacute stages (<3 months after stroke). But enhancing language recovery early after stroke is desirable because of its potential impact on long-term language outcomes and quality-of-life.\n\nThe current study will investigate the efficacy of high-definition tACS (HD-tACS) to help restore neural oscillatory activity in aphasia. TACS differs from tDCS in that sinusoidal, alternating currents are delivered rather than constant currents. TACS can manipulate the ongoing oscillatory neuronal activity and potentially increase functional synchronization (or connectivity) between targeted areas. This feature of tACS is quite attractive, given the new body of evidence suggesting that language impairments stem from diminished functional connectivity and disruptions in the language network due to stroke. The selection of tACS frequencies in this study is guided by our preliminary work examining pathological neural oscillations found near stroke-lesioned areas (or perilesional) in aphasia. By exogenously tuning the perilesional oscillations with tACS, the investigators hope to up-regulate communication across these areas and other connected areas to improve language outcome. If successful, tACS will be a powerful and novel treatment approach with reverberating positive impact on long-term recovery.\n\nThe study will employ HD-tACS in a within-subject and sham-controlled design, using two frequencies (alpha/10 Hz and low-gamma/40 Hz) combined with language tasks and electroencephalography (EEG) to evaluate subsequent behavioral and neurophysiological changes. Investigators plan to recruit 50 participants: 25 stroke survivors with aphasia at lease 1 month after stroke, and 25 healthy controls.\n\nParticipants will complete language testing that covers a broad range of language functions, medical history, and MRI. Eligible participants will undergo active tACS at 10 Hz or 40 Hz, or sham-tACS. All participants will receive all three stimulation types during separate visits. The tACS administrator and participants will be blinded to the stimulation type. The order of stimulation type will be counterbalanced across participants. Washout period between visits will be at least 48 hours to minimize potential carryover effects. EEG will be acquired before and after tACS during periods of rest (resting-state) and during language tasks. Participants will complete a questionnaire at the end of stimulation visits to assess potential side effects of tACS. Total time enrolled in the study is expected to be 2-3 weeks, which may be longer depending on participant's availability.","Keyword":"language language impairment transcranial alternating current stimulation tACS","StudyType":"Interventional","EligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\nHealthy Controls\n\n18 years of age or older\nFluent in English\nNo history of neurological or psychiatric disorders\n\nStroke Patients\n\nDiagnosed with post-stroke aphasia by referring physician/neuropsychologist\nConsent date >=1 months after stroke onset\nRight-handed\nFluent in English\n18 years of age or older\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nSevere cognitive, auditory or visual impairments that would preclude cognitive and language testing\nPresence of major untreated or unstable psychiatric disease\nA chronic medical condition that is not treated or is unstable\nThe presence of cardiac stimulators or pacemakers\nAny metal implants in the skull\nContraindications to MRI or tACS\nHistory of seizures\nHistory of dyslexia or other developmental learning disabilities","HealthyVolunteers":"Accepts Healthy Volunteers","MinimumAge":"18 Years","Gender":"All","LocationCity":"Milwaukee","LocationState":"Wisconsin","lon":-87.9064736,"lat":43.0389025,"z":1,"link":"https://rbcavanaugh.github.io/find-aphasia-research/list_View/NCT04375722","location":"online"},{"BriefTitle":"Impact of Neuromodulation on Language Impairments in Stroke Patients","Condition":"Stroke Aphasia","StartDate":"January 1, 2018","name":"NCT03699930","OrgFullName":"Casa Colina Hospital and Centers for Healthcare","BriefSummary":"Up to 40% of stroke survivors suffer from aphasia, making recovery of language abilities a top priority in stroke rehabilitation.

For this reason, the investigators are asking people with different versions of Alzheimer's disease to participate. This includes patients with either:\n\nPosterior cortical atrophy - a version of Alzheimer's disease with vision difficulties\nLogopenic variant primary progressive aphasia - a version of Alzheimer's disease with language difficulties\nAmnestic Alzheimer's disease - a \"typical\" version of Alzheimer's disease with memory difficulties\nThe investigators are also enrolling older adults with normal visual, language, and memory function.","DetailedDescription":"This study is being done to learn about inflammation in Alzheimer's disease so that the investigators can find out new ways to treat patients with this disease. Because Alzheimer's disease usually causes slow changes to the brain over time, in this study the investigators are going to perform different tests and then repeat some of them two years later.\n\nInflammation can be measured using a type of brain scan called a positron emission tomography (PET) scan. A PET scan uses very small amounts of a radioactive drug that is injected into a vein to create a special picture of the brain. The inflammation PET scan uses a drug called ER176. ER176 is an experimental drug but has been used in several human studies before. Once in the body, ER176 sticks to areas with lots of inflammation, and the PET scan allows us to see these areas.\n\nInflammation can also be measured by looking at certain proteins in the spinal fluid. In order to measure these proteins in the spinal fluid, the investigators need to perform a lumbar puncture (spinal tap). Certain genes that inherited from parents influence the amount of inflammation in the body. The investigators can study how genes affect inflammation in Alzheimer's disease by looking doing genetic tests on blood that collected from the vein.\n\nThe investigators can study how genes affect inflammation in Alzheimer's disease by doing genetic tests on blood. The investigators will also be testing blood for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)- CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) antibodies. The investigators want to see if exposure to the virus that causes COVID-19 changes the amount of inflammation in the brain or not.\n\nAlong with inflammation, Alzheimer's disease is also associated with the build up of the proteins amyloid and tau in the brain. The investigators can measure these proteins using PET scans. The amyloid PET scan uses a drug called florbetaben that has been approved by the FDA to help diagnose Alzheimer's disease. The tau PET scan uses a drug called MK-6240. Like ER176, MK-6240 is experimental but has been used in several human studies before.\n\nA brain MRI creates a high resolution picture of the brain. The brain MRI helps the investigators get more information from the PET scans, and can also tell the investigators the size and appearance of different brain structures.

Aphasia impacts language production and comprehension as well as reading and writing. The ramifications of aphasia extend beyond language impairment to negatively impacting a person's social, vocational, and recreational activities. Currently, the most effective way to treat aphasia is with speech-language therapy (SLT). However, even if SLT is intensive, persons with aphasia are left with residual language delays. Recent research suggests that pairing SLT with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) a non-invasive, safe, low-cost form of brain stimulation may aid language recovery in persons with aphasia. However, results from tDCS studies are inconclusive. The success of tDCS in combination with SLT could depend on the timing of tDCS since tDCS-induced effects depend on the neuronal state of the brain-networks at the time of the stimulation. In this study, the differential impact of tDCS before behavioral SLT (offline-before therapy), tDCS after SLT (offline-after therapy), and tDCS concurrently with SLT (online) on functional language recovery in persons with aphasia will be investigated. Sham tDCS (i.e., SLT alone) as a control group will also be included in the study. The investigators hypothesize that both offline and online tDCS will improve language functioning than sham tDCS.","DetailedDescription":"tDCS Implementation:\n\n2mA of direct current for 20 minutes will be delivered using a constant current stimulator via two electrodes in saline soaked sponges. To stimulate the left angular gyrus, a cathodal electrode inside a saline soaked sponge (5 x 3cm) will be placed over the CP5 according to the 10-20 international system for EEG electrode placement. The electrodes will be secured in position by a custom-built EEG cap that will be marked with the location for angular gyrus. The investigators will then confirm that the cathodal electrode is over the left angular through the use of neuronavigation. The \"return\" anode electrode will be placed in a saline soaked sponge (5 x 5cm) on the center of the supraorbital region.\n\nAt the beginning of the tDCS, current will slowly ram-up during the first few seconds until it reaches 2mA. The ramp-up process will acclimate the participants to tDCS-induced sensations (e.g., itching). At the end of the tDCS sessions, current will slowly ramp down in the last few seconds to 0mA. The total duration of the 2mA current will be maintained for 20 minutes. For sham stimulation, the investigators will place the electrodes in the same location as the real tDCS groups with stimulation ending after few seconds. The brief stimulation will produce tDCS-induced sensations so that participants will not be aware when the tDCS stopped delivering direct current\n\nSpeech-Language Treatment:\n\nStandard-of-care treatment - script training will be used to provide SLT to our participants. The treatment will be delivered via a computer program, Aphasia Scripts ®, whereby a virtual therapist interactively guides the participants through treatment steps. Scripts will be five to ten sentences and developed from common templates about topics relevant to daily life (e.g., asking questions at the grocery store, ordering in a restaurant). The advantage of using a computer program instead of a human therapist is that it removes extraneous variables associated with human therapists (e.g., different levels of encouragement) and this, together with the use of script templates, ensures treatment fidelity across participants.\n\nDuration of an individual subject's participation in the study:\n\nSubjects will be requested to come for baseline sessions (3 to 4 hours) before the actual experiment. The baseline assessments may be done over two visits. In the baseline session the subjects' aphasia severity will be assessed. The participants will also perform baseline tasks of language and cognition in this session. Subjects will then participate in 3 weeks of tDCS and SLT (i.e., 15 sessions).

Aphasia treatments include speech and language therapy and pharmacologic therapy, but several studies have found that these treatments are not completely effective for patients with aphasia, leaving them with residual deficits that significantly add to the cost of stroke-related care. Additionally, the amount and frequency of speech and language therapy delivered may have a critical effect on recovery. Therefore, there is a need for new treatments or adjuncts to existing treatments, such as brain stimulation interventions, that have the potential to show greater improvements in patients with aphasia. One such new approach for non-invasive brain stimulation is transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS).\n\nThis study will examine the effects of tDCS during speech therapy to further examine which method or methods is best for patient recovery.

Stroke-induced aphasia results in increased healthcare costs and decreased quality of life. As the population of Veterans continues to age, there will be an increasing number for Veterans living with the aphasia and its consequences. Those Veterans deserve to receive aphasia treatment designed to facilitate the best possible outcomes. In the proposed study, the investigators will investigate optimal treatment intensity and predictors of treatment response for a novel word retrieval treatment. The knowledge the investigators gain will have direct implications for the selecting the right treatment approach for the right Veteran.","DetailedDescription":"Difficulty retrieving words is one of the most common language complaints in individuals with stroke-induced aphasia. The negative consequences related to word retrieval impairment include increased health care costs and decreased quality of life. A variety of treatment approaches exist to improve word retrieval, and most of the treatments result in immediate improvement on trained words. However, long-term improvement and improvement on untrained words or behaviors is less common. Additionally, the investigators currently know very little about optimal treatment administration parameters, and the investigators know even less about predictors of treatment response. To make the best use of the limited clinical resources available for aphasia treatment, and to maximize outcomes for Veterans with aphasia, the investigators must: 1) develop clinically translatable treatments that yield widespread and lasting effects and 2) develop clinically accessible ways of identifying who will acquire benefit from a specific treatment approach. This study takes on these two challenges by investigating dose frequency (massed vs. distributed practice) effects and by identifying the language, cognitive and neural predictors of response to Intention treatment (INT), a novel word retrieval treatment. Specifically, the investigators will address the following aims:\n\nAim 1: To investigate dose frequency effects on maintenance and generalization of INT gains. Outcome measure: Word retrieval accuracy for trained and untrained words.\n\nAim 2: To identify the language and cognitive variables that predict response to m-INT vs. d-INT.

Spatial-motor-sensory problems limit functioning and independence, which is costly to Veterans, their families, and society. Currently, spatial-motor-sensory problems are targeted using different treatments. However, there is a treatment that has shown promise in simultaneously targeting spatial function, motor function and pain in right-brain stroke. The investigators propose to investigate the feasibility of using adapted spatial-motor sensory assessment and treatment procedures for Veterans with left-brain stroke who have language and cognitive impairment. The next step will be to conduct a large-scale study focused on this multi-target treatment for more efficient and effective stroke rehabilitation. The investigators expect this line of research to increase functioning, independence and quality of life in Veteran stroke survivors.","DetailedDescription":"The functional disability experienced by Veterans after stroke, and the limited rehabilitation resources available, highlight the importance of identifying feasible treatments acting on more than one recovery target. Currently, there are separate and modality-specific treatment pathways for cognitive and motor impairments. These modality-specific treatment pathways lead to fragmentation of care, and under-identification and under-treatment of invisible disabilities, such as spatial neglect, aphasia and pain. The result is longer hospital stays, greater risk of falls, and poor functional outcomes. Employing a treatment that simultaneously addresses multiple targets will ensure that the investigators provide the needed care for >50% of post-stroke Veterans who have both visible and invisible disabilities, during the critical post-acute period of recovery.\n\nPrism adaptation treatment (PAT) is a 10-day regimen reported to be inexpensive, replicable and effective for treatment of spatial neglect, and studies have demonstrated that it also enhances everyday activities and motor recovery and reduces chronic post-stroke pain in patients with right brain stroke.

No studies have investigated PAT in left-brain stroke patients with language and cognitive impairment. To address this research gap, the investigators will address the following aims:\n\nAim 1: To demonstrate the feasibility of adapted PAT procedures in patients with aphasia and memory impairment. .\n\nAim 2: To demonstrate the feasibility of adapted methods for assessing spatial and motor function and pain in patients with aphasia and memory impairment.\n\nAim 3: To demonstrate the feasibility of using information about lesion location from the radiology report to classify frontal vs. nonfrontal lesions.","Keyword":"aphasia spatial neglect rehabilitation","StudyType":"Interventional","EligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1-3 months post-stroke, entering outpatient treatment\nproficient English speakers\nexperiencing moderate functional disability as measured by Functional Independence Measure (FIM), observational or telephone-administered FONE-FIM\nexperiencing aphasia as determined by a Western Aphasia Battery Aphasia Quotient and memory impairment as determined by the Brief Visuospatial Memory Test- Revised, the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test- Revised or digit span forward and backward\nable to provide informed consent to participate, using aphasia-accessible process, as needed.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nHistory of brain conditions other than left brain stroke, including clinical right brain pathology.","HealthyVolunteers":"No","MinimumAge":"18 Years","Gender":"All","LocationCity":"Decatur","LocationState":"Georgia","lon":-84.2963123,"lat":33.7748275,"z":1,"link":"https://rbcavanaugh.github.io/find-aphasia-research/list_View/NCT04387162","location":"on site"}],"type":"mapbubble","name":"On Site Study","minSize":"5%","maxSize":"5%","color":"rgba(0,0,139,0.3)","tooltip":{"pointFormat":"<a href='{point.link}'>{point.BriefTitle}<\/a>"}}],"tooltip":{"style":{"pointerEvents":"auto"}},"mapNavigation":{"enabled":true}},"theme":{"chart":{"backgroundColor":"transparent"},"colors":["#7cb5ec","#434348","#90ed7d","#f7a35c","#8085e9","#f15c80","#e4d354","#2b908f","#f45b5b","#91e8e1"]},"conf_opts":{"global":{"Date":null,"VMLRadialGradientURL":"http =//code.highcharts.com/list(version)/gfx/vml-radial-gradient.png","canvasToolsURL":"http =//code.highcharts.com/list(version)/modules/canvas-tools.js","getTimezoneOffset":null,"timezoneOffset":0,"useUTC":true},"lang":{"contextButtonTitle":"Chart context menu","decimalPoint":".","downloadCSV":"Download CSV","downloadJPEG":"Download JPEG image","downloadPDF":"Download PDF document","downloadPNG":"Download PNG image","downloadSVG":"Download SVG vector image","downloadXLS":"Download XLS","drillUpText":"◁ Back to {series.name}","exitFullscreen":"Exit from full screen","exportData":{"annotationHeader":"Annotations","categoryDatetimeHeader":"DateTime","categoryHeader":"Category"},"hideData":"Hide data table","invalidDate":null,"loading":"Loading...","months":["January","February","March","April","May","June","July","August","September","October","November","December"],"noData":"No data to display","numericSymbolMagnitude":1000,"numericSymbols":["k","M","G","T","P","E"],"printChart":"Print chart","resetZoom":"Reset zoom","resetZoomTitle":"Reset zoom level 1:1","shortMonths":["Jan","Feb","Mar","Apr","May","Jun","Jul","Aug","Sep","Oct","Nov","Dec"],"shortWeekdays":["Sat","Sun","Mon","Tue","Wed","Thu","Fri"],"thousandsSep":" ","viewData":"View data table","viewFullscreen":"View in full screen","weekdays":["Sunday","Monday","Tuesday","Wednesday","Thursday","Friday","Saturday"]}},"type":"map","fonts":[],"debug":false},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>
