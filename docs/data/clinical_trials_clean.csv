"1",1,"Conversation Group Treatment for Aphasia: Does it Work?","Aphasia, Acquired","April 15, 2022","NCT05113160","Boston University Charles River Campus Boston Massachusetts United States","Boston University Charles River Campus","Recruiting","The proposed research will test the efficacy of group conversation treatment for people with aphasia and explore whether the effects of treatment differ as a result of the following factors:

Group size: Do large groups of 6-8 people with aphasia or dyads of 2 people with aphasia demonstrate different levels of improvement with this treatment?
Group composition: Do effects of conversation group treatment differ if the groups include members with similar or different types of aphasia?
Aphasia severity: Do effects of conversation group treatment differ if the individuals within the group have mild-moderate or moderate-severe profiles of aphasia?

Treatment sessions will occur in groups of 6-8 people with aphasia or with 2 people with aphasia. During treatment sessions, discourse will be facilitated on a focused set of every day topics, such as current events or travel. Linguistic and multi modal cueing hierarchies will be tailored to individual client goals and used to maximize communication success.

The prediction is that conversation treatment is an effective method for improving communication in people with aphasia, but that specific benefits may differ based on variables such as group size, group composition, and aphasia severity. The results will help inform best practices for aphasia treatment and refine a hypothesized model about the mechanisms underlying conversation treatment.","Aphasia is a language disorder that affects approximately two million Americans. The communication barriers associated with aphasia limit the ability to return to work and hobbies, worsen social relationships, and lead to social isolation. Social isolation is correlated with many negative health outcomes, including mortality. As a result, the consequences of aphasia can be wide reaching and severe. Group treatment has the potential to improve communication and reduce social isolation, while also reducing medical costs. However, this treatment format lacks a strong evidence base.

This research uses a hypothesis-driven approach to test the efficacy of conversation treatment and develop and refine a mechanistic pathway of how conversation treatment leads to behavioral changes in communication ability. We will systematically explore whether the effects of treatment differ as a result of number of participants (large group or dyad), group composition (heterogenous versus homogenous profiles of aphasia), and severity of aphasia. The study will enroll a total of 168 participants with aphasia across three sites. In cycle one, 72 participants will be randomly assigned to one of three conditions: dyad treatment, traditional group treatment or delayed control group. In cycles two and three, 48 participants with severe aphasia and 48 participants with mild-moderate aphasia will be randomly assigned to either large group or dyad conditions. In all cycles, treatment will occur for 60 minutes, twice per week for 10 weeks.

During treatment sessions, a speech pathologist will facilitate discourse on a focused set of salient topics, such as current events, using individualized, linguistic and multimodal cueing hierarchies. The primary outcome measure is a functional measure of communication (Aphasia Communication Outcome Measure, ACOM; Hula et al., 2015). Secondary outcome measures will include standardized tests and patient reported outcome measures, and examine linguistic and functional communication abilities. All participants will be assessed pre-, post-, 4 weeks post- and 12 weeks post-treatment.

The proposed research will address the following specific aims. Specific Aim 1 is to examine efficacy of conversation treatment delivered in dyads and large groups compared to a delayed-treatment control group. Specific Aim 2 is to determine optimal parameters for conversation treatment by testing whether the treatment effects differ as a function of aphasia severity (2A) or group composition (2B). Specific Aim 3 will test a hypothesized model of the pathway by which conversation treatment effects behavioral change. The results will provide further efficacy for conversation treatment and inform about the optimal parameters and outcomes of this intervention.

The well-being of these individuals is affected not just by the loss of words that is aphasia, but also the loss of friendships and opportunities for community engagement in which the loss of words can result. This study evaluates an animal-assisted treatment, The Persons with Aphasia Training Dogs (PATD) Program, designed to target the psychosocial consequences of aphasia by training participants in positive reinforcement dog training techniques that harness new skill learning and the advantages of interaction with family- or shelter-dwelling dogs to increase confidence and social engagement to support participants in living well with aphasia.","Our long-term goals are to evaluate the effectiveness of canine- assisted therapy for persons with aphasia and to operationalize aphasia treatments targeting psychosocial consequences of aphasia such that they may be implemented with fidelity across clinical settings. The overall objective of this application is to determine the feasibility and impact of a canine-assisted therapy program, the Persons with Aphasia Training Dogs (PATD) Program. This feasibility study, a crucial first step toward our long-term goals, will evaluate participants' ability to learn positive reinforcement dog training techniques, and provide data regarding the impact of treatment with respect to feasibility metrics associated with recruitment, retention, compliance, and importantly, program satisfaction/acceptability. The hypotheses are that PWA are able to learn positive reinforcement techniques to apply to dog training and that retention, compliance, and program satisfaction rates for this canine-assisted treatment will be high, with program satisfaction linked to psychosocial benefits such as increased self-confidence and social engagement for PWA. These hypotheses have been formulated on the basis of the PI's funded work designing and implementing the PATD program for the MossRehab Aphasia Center, as well as work in aphasia rehabilitation and canine-assisted interventions, including those with persons with aphasia. Accomplishment of the overall objective of this application will be achieved through this small-scale feasibility study aimed to garner preliminary support for our hypotheses and provide data to inform design of a future, large-scale clinical trial.

Specific Aim 1: Determine whether PWA, through participation in the PATD program, can learn and implement positive reinforcement techniques to train dogs in basic obedience skills. Hypothesis 1: On program completion, PWA will be competent in using positive reinforcement techniques, to independently cue a dog to complete a minimum of 4 (of 5) trained obedience skills. To test this hypothesis, participants will be assessed using a PI-adapted version of the Pet Partners© Animal-Handler Evaluation.

Specific Aim 2: Define participant characteristics associated with recruitment, retention, compliance and program acceptability/satisfaction relevant for determining PATD candidacy. Hypothesis 2: PWA will demonstrate high (above 80%) retention and compliance rates, and high program satisfaction, including increases in self-reported ratings of psychosocial well-being. To test this hypothesis, our primary outcome measure will be the Assessment of Living with Aphasia, complemented by self-report of participants' PATD experience gathered through an ALA-modeled qualitative spoken interview and a written, aphasia-friendly, satisfaction survey.

Accomplishment of the overall objective of this application will be achieved through this small-scale, feasibility study aimed to garner preliminary support for our hypotheses and to provide the foundation for a future, large-scale clinical trial.

To test this hypothesis, program participants will be assessed using a PI-adapted version of the Pet Partners© Animal-Handler Evaluation.

Skills Training: In consultation with a certified professional dog trainer, the PATD program was developed by the PI, a trained speech language-pathologist with eighteen years of experience working with people with aphasia, who has spent more than ten years working with shelter animals using positive reinforcement techniques. Participants enrolled in the PATD program will engage in five once-weekly individual training sessions with the PI, either with a family dog (PATD) or by volunteering at a local shelter, the Pennsylvania SPCA (PATD-PSPCA). PATD-PSPCA participants will work only with dogs that have been evaluated by PSPCA staff as appropriate for interaction with new volunteers. Each session will be dedicated to one of five pre-determined, sequentially-presented, obedience skills (i.e., LOOK, TOUCH, SIT, STAY, COME). Training sessions will last approximately 75 minutes, with an additional half hour allotted to the beginning of the first training session to review principles of positive-reinforcement training. Subsequent sessions will begin with a brief probe of the participant's skill in cueing the dog to perform the behavior trained the previous week. Following the probe, sessions will continue with a review of that week's lesson plan, after which the PI will model the first training step three times. After the model has been provided, the participant will attempt the procedure, receiving instructive feedback or reinforcement from the trainer. Instruction will proceed to the subsequent step when the participant and dog have attained 5 successful trials at the current step. The same demonstration procedure will be used at each subsequent step. Commands will be trained using one hand gesture for each behavior. To mark behaviors, participants will use a clicker attached to a wrist band, which can be hand-held or allowed to dangle for ease of use for those with hemiplegia. Participants will have the option of introducing the verbal command, but will not be required to do so. All participants will be asked to provide their dog with a walk before training sessions to support the dog in being ready to participate.

Skills Practice: Participants will not be required to complete all steps for an obedience skill in a single session, and will be encouraged to practice the skill with the dog for at least 3 practice sessions over the course of the week. Practice will be used as a measure of participant compliance. Each participant will be provided with a copy of the lesson plan and, if interested, a video demonstrating the PI performing the target skill with her own dog. Participants will also be provided with a training log to complete after each time they practice over the course of the week. Using a nine-point visual analog scale adapted from the Assessment of Living with Aphasia (ALA), participants will rate their own and the dog's performance during each practice session. To facilitate responses on the log, participants will be provided with a pictographic list of questions to consider in determining their ratings (e.g., ""How many times did I have to cue the dog"", ""Did I 'click' as soon as the dog did what I asked?"".

Specific Aim 2: Define participant characteristics associated with recruitment, retention, compliance and program acceptability/satisfaction relevant for determining PATD candidacy. Hypothesis 2: PWA will demonstrate high (above 80%) retention and compliance rates, and high program satisfaction, including increases in self-reported ratings of psychosocial well-being. To test this hypothesis, the primary outcome measure will be the Assessment of Living with Aphasia, complemented by self-report of participants' PATD experience gathered through an ALA-modeled qualitative spoken interview and a written, aphasia-friendly, satisfaction survey.

Feasibility Metrics: Recruitment rates will be tracked appropriate to the creation of a CONSORT flow diagram including: # contacted, # screened, # eligible (vs. ineligible), # consented/enrolled (vs. declined). To evaluate further the size of the population that may benefit from the treatment, participant screening will include surveying of interest in interaction with dogs and in dog-related activities. Similarly, participant retention rates will be tracked including: # completing baseline assessment, # completing immediate post-treatment assessment, and # completing follow-up assessment. Participant withdrawals will be tracked for whether initiated by researcher or participant. Participant compliance rates will be tracked including # assessment and training sessions (relative to total possible) completed, and # self-reported home practice sessions.

Outcome Measurement: The primary quantitative outcome measure of acceptability, the ALA, is a pictographic self-report measure of quality of life developed to assess the impact of aphasia on daily life. Questions address participants' perceptions of aphasia, their environment, their relationships, their community engagement, experiences of self-confidence and respect, and their progress toward ""living well with aphasia"". Participants respond by pointing to a visual analog scale, providing for quantification of responses, and rendering the tool accessible to those with language impairment. Overall score and subdomain scores have demonstrated acceptable-to-high test-retest reliability and internal consistency. To augment standardized evaluation, the PI has developed a complementary interview, consistent with the format of the ALA, to more specifically probe PATD participants' perceptions of the impact of the training program. Participant narratives produced during the administration will be supported using interviewing strategies appropriate for persons with aphasia. A written, visual analog scale satisfaction survey designed to adhere to guidelines of 'aphasia-friendly' written materials will also be administered. It is anticipated that the assessment battery will take two hours to complete.

Outcome Measurement/Participation Timeline: Participants will be randomized into immediate and waitlist treatment groups using permuted block randomization with stratification. Analysis between these two arms will be exploratory only in nature, and will inform us regarding the feasibility of the waitlist control design for use in a larger clinical trial. All participants will be evaluated before training begins, immediately following training, and at a 3-month follow-up. Participants in the delayed arm will participate in two pre-training evaluations, one immediately upon enrollment and one at the end of the delay period immediately before beginning training.","aphasia animal-assisted therapy","Interventional","Inclusion Criteria:

The participants are consecutively recruited from a rehabilitation centre providing intensive treatment for chronic conditions following stroke or other neurological injuries. The speech-language pathologists (SLPs) involved in the rehabilitation programs perform the testing directly before and after intensive intervention with an additional follow up after 16 weeks (+-2) with testing of speech-language, communication and quality of life. The SLPs have more than five years of experience of working with aphasia and are specialised in working with intensive treatment, they have acquired in-depth knowledge on how to evaluate and treat aphasia and apraxia of speech in lectures and workshops. The test procedure is recorded with camcorder and voice recorder to provide the opportunity to access data retrospectively and to minimize bias by including an external SLP who makes a second blinded evaluation on randomized participants' performance in ASRS, BNT and CAT by studying the video and voice material. Structural and functional neuroplasticity is also investigated with voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis, resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) in domain-specific (language processing) and domain-general (executive and attention processing). This intensive neuro-rehabilitation program for speech and language deficits named Multimodal Intensive Rehabilitation for Aphasia and Apraxia of Speech (MIRAA) is defined as an ICAP (Intensive Comprehensive Aphasia Program) with focus on both speech and language function and communicative activity and participation. The program is intensive: consisting of ten days of training (5 hours/day), with a minimum of three hours dedicated to speech and language rehabilitation with additional physical therapy. The program includes both individual treatment, group therapy and computer-based therapy. The therapy is individually set up after the participant's goals together with the team including SLPs, physiotherapists and a board-certified neurologist and/or specialist in rehabilitation medicine. The goals are set by the participants, family members and clinicians the first day of the program. The participant and their significant other are offered education with the aim to enhance the knowledge on communication, the key concepts of neuroplasticity and other functions and strategies important in everyday life. The treatment methods being used are evidence-based and/or widely used multimodal programs covering the need for extensive training programs targeting both impairment-based therapy and functional communication. The specific questions are: Does ten days of with an intensive comprehensive aphasia/AOS program result in any clinical significant improvements in speech and/or language function and other cognitive skills for participants with chronic aphasia and/or apraxia of speech? Does the intensive intervention have any effect on the quality of everyday life concerning speech and language functions, activity and communicative participation for people with chronic aphasia and apraxia of speech?

However, not all patients with aphasia have access to adequate treatment to maximize their recovery. The goal of this project is to compare the efficacy of telerehabilitation or Aphasia Remote Therapy (ART) to the more traditional In-Clinic Therapy (I-CT).","Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the United States. One of the most debilitating impairments resulting from stroke is aphasia, a language disorder caused by damage to the left hemisphere of the brain. While evidence shows that aphasia therapy improves speech production and communicative quality of life in persons with chronic (>6 months) stroke-induced aphasia, the amount of therapy provided to patients in the United States is typically far less than what is probably necessary to maximize recovery. There are a few important reasons underlying this discrepancy. For example, considerable emphasis is placed on acute and subacute stroke recovery with less therapy focus on the chronic period, when recovery is usually slower. Also, access to rehabilitation services can be limited by the availability of providers (e.g., in rural regions) or by difficulties with transportation logistics related to disabilities and the physical sequelae of stroke. One way to increase access to aphasia therapy is to rely on telerehabilitation (a.k.a., aphasia remote therapy; ART). So far, telerehabilitation in stroke has primarily focused on physical therapy, with only a handful of smaller studies involving aphasia therapy. The purpose of this study is to compare aphasia therapy administered via ART to aphasia therapy administered in person (In-Clinic Therapy; I-CT). We will conduct the first phase II, non-inferiority trial of telerehabilitation for aphasia therapy that is exclusively administered by a speech-language pathologist. Participants with chronic aphasia will be randomized to either a telerehabilitation or aphasia remote therapy (ART) group or an in-clinic therapy (I-CT) group relying on the same therapy approach currently used in our ongoing POLAR study. The outcome measure will focus on speech production and combines correct naming on the Philadelphia Naming Test and correct words produced per minute (CWPM) during discourse. The primary endpoint is change in the outcome measure at 6 months compared to baseline. The non-inferiority margin will be set so that if ART leads to less than 50% improvement than the improvement following I-CT, it will be considered inferior for therapy delivery. Neuroimaging will be used to evaluate how aphasia is shaped by the stroke lesion in combination with residual brain integrity.","aphasia stroke telerehabilitation speech-language therapy","Interventional","Inclusion Criteria:

It will do so by incorporating communication supports and compensatory speech-language treatment. The goal of developing this integrated treatment is to improve successful communication participation, psychosocial adjustment, and quality of life for stroke survivors with aphasia.

In the first phase of the project, the investigators will create a treatment manual with input from a stakeholder advisory board consisting of caregivers and stroke survivors with aphasia. The investigators will then recruit an initial cohort of five stroke survivors with aphasia to undergo the initial version of the treatment based and provide feedback. This will aid revision of the manual, which the investigators will then evaluate using a second cohort of 16 stroke survivors with aphasia. The investigators predict that ACT for Aphasia will be acceptable and feasible based on measures of participant satisfaction and treatment adherence. The investigators will also measure pre- to post-treatment changes in psychological distress, functional disability, quality of life, and communication participation and functioning to establish preliminary effect size estimates for this intervention, in preparation for a subsequent Stage II efficacy trial.","The overarching goals of this research are to improve psychosocial adjustment, quality of life, and successful communication participation by developing Act for Aphasia, a patient-centered, manualized behavioral intervention in Stage I research. Stroke survivors with aphasia within 5 years post stroke will complete a 10-session intervention. In study Aim 1, the investigators will engage a Stakeholder Advisory Board (SAB) of people with aphasia (PWA) and caregivers to provide input to develop a treatment manual. The investigators will then use an iterative design process and two successive participant cohorts to refine the manual. Cohort 1 (N=5) will participate in the initial version of the treatment, then help inform its revision by being invited to join the SAB. Cohort 2 (N=16) will participate in the revised version. In Aim 2a the investigators will establish feasibility and acceptability of this intervention. In Aim 2b the investigators will estimate preliminary effect sizes for a subsequent Stage II efficacy trial.

Participant assignment: given the early phase of this research and the lack of control conditions or groups, there will be no random assignment. Participants will be enrolled in the study as they are referred and found to be eligible, with the first five participants being enrolled in the first study cohort during year 1 while the remainder of participants will be enrolled in the second cohort across years 1 and 2.

Intervention description: the ACT for Aphasia treatment manual will be a 10-session intervention created by modifying an existing ACT manual provided by Dr. Meyer. To meet the specific needs of stroke survivors with aphasia, ACT will be modified in two main ways. First, the intervention will include modified language and communication supports to address the unique communication challenges faced by people with aphasia that could impede engagement with ACT content. Multi-modality communication supports will be provided by the treating clinician (e.g., writing out key words to support verbal content, summarizing and providing repetitions, providing session summaries to review between sessions). Manual creation will follow existing practice recommendations for modifying counseling interventions for PWA (e.g., simplifying language and increasing use of visual metaphors) which will be reviewed by the SAB. Second, ACT will be further augmented via individualized language compensation training and a focus on identifying and addressing communication-based barriers to life participation. Language training will focus on active compensatory strategies such as self-cuing, use of alternative modalities (gesture, writing), and use of commonly available technology (e.g., smartphone dictionaries, text-to-speech). The details of this language compensation training will also be determined based on input from the SAB, and will be revised after reviewing performance and interview feedback from each successive cohort.

Intervention administration procedures: all aspects of the treatment protocol will be administered by Dr. Evans or a licensed speech-language pathologist on study staff who has received training in providing ACT. The intervention will consist of 10 weekly treatment sessions. Post-treatment interviews providing feedback for protocol revision will be administered by Dr. Evans within 2 weeks of study completion. Interviews will use a semi-structured, ethnographic interview approach and be video-recorded. These interviews will ask specific questions about the participant's experience and perspective regarding each functional domain of the intervention (i.e., the ""Open Up,"" ""Be Present,"" and ""Do What Matters"" components of ACT and the individualized language compensation training), and will be asked for suggestions and improvements about the specific content and techniques employed.","Counseling Therapeutics","Interventional","Inclusion Criteria:

Semantic feature analysis treatment has a strong evidence base and capacity to improve word retrieval by encouraging circumlocution. Circumlocution facilitates self-cued naming and assists listener comprehension when naming fails. However, semantic feature analysis treatment does not include direct techniques to teach patients with aphasia to generalize the use of semantic feature analysis treatment's circumlocution procedure. Therefore, this study proposes that combining semantic feature analysis treatment and metacognitive strategy training will stimulate the semantic system and increase patients with aphasias' use of circumlocution across divergent contexts.

This study aims to measure the treatment's effect on naming accuracy for trained and untrained items. The study also aim to measure the treatment's effect on people with aphasias' knowledge of the strategy components and changes in verbalizations during retrieval attempts. The central hypothesis is that strategy training will increase patients with aphasias' explicit knowledge about circumlocution and enable them to use it to (1) self-facilitate naming, and (2) produce more informative connected speech.","Every 40 seconds, someone in the United States suffers from a stroke. Approximately 25% of stroke survivors acquire aphasia, a communication disorder that can result in a partial or total loss of spoken and written language ability, which significantly and negatively impacts quality of life and societal participation. The ability to verbally label objects, referred to as 'naming' in the literature, is impaired in all patients with aphasia. Naming is, therefore, a common focus of treatment. Naming treatments improve people with aphasias' naming ability for items that are directly trained during therapy. However, these same treatments face two critical limitations: (1) inconsistent generalization to untrained items, and (2) little to no generalization to spontaneous, connected speech. As it is impossible to train the entire universe of objects during a patient's course of therapy, generalization of gains beyond what is trained in therapy is crucial.

Recent work shows that patients with aphasias' learning success depends on their ability to develop optimal strategies that support learning, but that they do not develop these strategies independently. There is also evidence that through explicit strategy training, patients with aphasia can learn to implement and generalize the use of strategies that are known to support learning, and carry over their use across multiple environments. As such, it is predicted that naming treatment outcomes would be greatly improved by incorporating strategy training into treatment.

This study proposes to incorporate strategy training into naming treatment to improve generalization. Circumlocution, a verbal behavior in which patients with aphasia describe an object's features if they are unable to name it, is known to facilitate naming and assist listener comprehension. Semantic Feature Analysis is a well-regarded naming treatment thought to encourage circumlocution. Semantic Feature Analysis treatment does not include direct techniques that teach patients with aphasia how to generalize the use of the treatment's circumlocution procedure. In fact, no studies have explicitly trained patients with aphasia how to use the circumlocution procedure they learn in Semantic Feature Analysis treatment during everyday communication. Rather, it is assumed that patients with aphasia will implicitly learn how to use the procedure, through repeated practice and habituation alone. This study proposes that strategy training is the integral missing piece that will successfully result in people with aphasias' generalized application of the semantic feature analysis procedure.

The objective of the proposed research is to determine whether naming treatment that incorporates strategy training results in people with aphasias' increased use of circumlocution. The central hypothesis is that strategy training will increase patients with aphasias' explicit knowledge about circumlocution and enable them to use it to (1) self-facilitate naming, and (2) produce more informative connected speech. It is predicted that increased use of circumlocution will result in generalization at both the impairment level (naming) and participation level (effective communication).","Aphasia; Naming; Circumlocution","Interventional","Inclusion criteria:

The aim of the planned study is to explore the potential of the noninvasive repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) as a therapeutic tool for aphasia in addition to traditional behavioral therapy. In case of aphasia, studies on therapeutic effectiveness of rTMS aim to increase the activity of the language-dominant left cerebral hemisphere, which may be achieved in an indirect manner by inhibiting the activity of the opposite (right) hemisphere or in a direct manner by increasing the excitability of preserved language areas in the left hemisphere. In our study, we plan to administer the newest form of rTMS called Theta Burst Stimulation (TBS), which is safer than the conventional rTMS, even when used in the perilesional area. Computer-based neuronavigation system will be implemented to precisely localize stimulation targets, control administration of stimuli during rTMS sessions, and evaluate differences between participants regarding deviations from established stimulation points. 45 patients (all right-handed, polish native speakers, aged 18-75 years, diagnosed with non-fluent aphasia) will be enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled trial.

According to the Embodied Cognition approach (EC), language is tightly connected to the motor system. In this view, language rehabilitation programs should stimulate language through the activation of the motor system. In this approach, since anomic deficits are often due to a weak link between the meaning of the word and its lemma, the Hebbs' principles of coincident and correlated learning can be exploited, i.e., by intensifying the synchronous activation of lexicon and semantics and connecting them with the motor counterpart. In this study, the investigators present an innovative training, based on the EC framework, in which they will make use of new technologies for anomia rehabilitation in post-stroke patients.

For PWA, word retrieval changes moment-to-moment, leading to diminished motivation to participate in conversations and disengagement from social interactions. In the real world, anomia variability and severity are compounded by contextual factors of communication exchanges (noise, dual-tasking). Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) involves in-situ measurement of a behavior over time during everyday life. EMA has promise for capturing real-world anomia, yet EMA methods have not been tested in PWA. Therefore, the aims of this pilot study are to (1) determine the relative feasibility of two types of smartwatch-delivered EMA (traditional-EMA and micro-EMA) in PWA and (2) determine the extent to which patient-specific factors relate to feasibility. Twenty PWA will be recruited and randomly assigned to either traditional-EMA or micro-EMA conditions. To target in-situ anomia, PWA will complete 36 picture-naming trials/day for three weeks, delivered either as a single trial 36 times per day (micro-EMA) or in four sets of nine trials/set per day (traditional-EMA). Due to the ""at-a-glance"" single trial delivery of micro-EMA, the investigators hypothesize that PWA in the micro-EMA condition will demonstrate better protocol adherence than PWA in the traditional-EMA condition. Older age, more severe cognitive-linguistic deficits, and greater discomfort with technology will be related to poorer compliance, lower completion, greater perceived burden, and lower intelligibility of naming audio recordings.

Aphasia, a disorder characterized by receptive and/or expressive language deficits, affects approximately 30% of stroke survivors and is one of the most devastating post-stroke conditions. Aphasia is a heterogenous disorder, yet anomia (i.e., impaired word retrieval) is a persistent, ubiquitous impairment present in all people with aphasia (PWA). Neurotypical individuals occasionally experience anomia during ""tip-of-the-tongue"" moments: frustrating instances when someone knows what they want to say but the word itself eludes them. For the two million Americans currently living with aphasia, word retrieval difficulties are far more severe and pervade all communication attempts. Anomia severity ranges between PWA, from mild difficulties such as delayed retrieval of low frequency words (e.g., amulet) to severe difficulty retrieving the names of even common objects (e.g., bed). Yet, regardless of severity, a hallmark of post-stroke anomia is inconsistent word retrieval across attempts for a given word. For PWA, the ability to access words can change day-to-day and even minute-to-minute, resulting in diminished motivation to participate in conversations, disengagement from social interactions, and reduced quality of life.

Per psycholinguistic models of lexical access, naming is a two-step process that involves retrieval of the target's meaning from the semantic system and word form (speech sounds) from the phonological system. Naming failures in PWA result in errors that are related to a target word in meaning (e.g., ""carrot"" for bean), word form (e.g., ""fean"" for bean), both meaning and form (e.g., ""green"" for bean), or neither (e.g., ""pencil"" for bean; ""I know it but I can't say it"" for bean) due to insufficient activation of the target meaning/form representations or overactivation of incorrect representations. Due to this noisy system, lexical access is often delayed in PWA, even when the correct word is eventually retrieved. Naming accuracy, response times, and error types provide meaningful information regarding the locus of naming impairment and a patient's recovery capacity. The investigators found that the number of phonological and unrelated errors produced during early post-stroke stages predicted longitudinal changes in naming and global language skills in left hemisphere stroke survivors. Naming errors and the integrity of underlying semantic and phonological systems can also guide language treatment planning. As such, accurate assessment of naming is critical for aphasia care.

In clinical practice, speech-language pathologists (SLPs) typically assess naming deficits through a single administration of a test in a quiet clinic room in a 1:1 interaction between the SLP and patient. Yet, given the variability in word retrieval, a one-time assessment cannot accurately capture the true nature and extent of a patient's anomia. Moreover, unlike a controlled, contrived clinical environment, word retrieval in the real world usually occurs while an individual performs other daily tasks, often in distracting, noisy environments and with many other people present. The added cognitive load of multi-tasking and suppressing external distractors adds to an already noisy lexical system, thereby increasing the chance of delayed or failed word retrieval. Traditional SLP assessment cannot capture the realities of real-world anomia, but the investigators argue that ecological momentary assessment (EMA) can.

EMA is a widely used method in health research to capture longitudinal self-reported behaviors or states of interest (e.g., physical activity, depression, diet) in daily life. In traditional EMA, an electronic device prompts a participant to answer a set of questions (usually via button press) many times a day over time. Answering several questions at a time is time intensive, and thus, a key disadvantage of traditional EMA is interruption burden. In contrast, micro-interaction-based EMA (µEMA) reduces each prompt to a single question that can be answered in ~3-5s, allowing for many more questions interspersed over time. The investigators' pilot studies suggest that even with an interruption rate eight times more than traditional EMA, µEMA has higher response rates and lower perceived burden than traditional EMA. Furthermore, µEMA yields temporally dense in-situ measures, making it an ideal tool for capturing the variability of anomia in the daily lives of PWA. One caveat is that an anomia µEMA/EMA protocol would necessitate recording verbal responses, yet traditional EMA and µEMA protocols to date have only required nonverbal responses via a button press or screen tap. The feasibility of capturing high-quality audio responses in a µEMA or traditional EMA protocol is unknown.

Moreover, despite the increasing use of technology-based assessments and therapy platforms for aphasia, neither electronically delivered EMA nor µEMA has been tested in PWA. In fact, based on a review from 2020, only seven studies have used EMA to study stroke recovery and none targeted language impairments. A central question is whether stroke survivors with aphasia can adhere to electronically delivered traditional EMA or µEMA anomia protocols. Prior research regarding tablet and computer-based platforms for aphasia indicates that PWA with better visuospatial attention and executive functions are better able to learn how to navigate a novel iPad application. Evidence suggests that SLP support is associated with greater adherence to a computerized therapy program for PWA and that patients' perceived engagement in the computer program is related to opportunities for practice, their ability to use the technology, and their motivation. An important step towards broader implementation of EMA and/or µEMA in aphasia is determining PWA's adherence to such protocols and which patient-specific factors are associated with protocol adherence.

Thus, as a future step toward broader-scope research goals, in this pilot, the investigators will (1) determine the relative feasibility of two smartwatch-delivered overt naming EMA protocols in PWA and (2) determine the extent to which patient-specific factors (age, cognitive-linguistic deficit severity, and comfort with technology) relate to feasibility. All participants will be scheduled to complete the same number of naming trials over the course of the experiment, but some PWA will be randomly assigned to a traditional EMA protocol (involving four prompts per day with nine naming trials per prompt) whereas other PWA will be assigned to a µEMA protocol (involving a single naming trial delivered at a time 36 times per day). Feasibility will be measured in three ways: in terms of (1) patients' ability to adhere to the EMA/µEMA protocol, (2) patients' perceived burden of completing the protocol, and (3) the capacity to capture recorded audio of naming attempts. The first two feasibility measures are similar to those used in the investigators' prior work, whereas the final measure is unique to this study since this pilot constitutes the first attempt at using EMA/µEMA to objectively measure verbal responses in stroke survivors

Innovation Despite the small scope of this pilot study, several innovative features comprise this research. This pilot will be the first study to evaluate the feasibility of electronically delivered EMA protocols in stroke survivors with aphasia. The comparison of traditional EMA and µEMA protocols in a clinical population is also novel. This work will be critical in determining which delivery method works best for PWA who differ from previously-studied neurotypical samples in meaningful ways. In addition, EMA research typically utilizes self-report measures to catalogue mental or cognitive states in daily life. In contrast, this pilot will attempt to objectively measure the cognitive-linguistic skill of naming through audio recordings of naming attempts in patients' daily lives. Such a paradigm has not been attempted before and thus, it is simultaneously original and risky with the potential for high reward. If it is feasible to obtain intelligible naming responses in an EMA/µEMA paradigm, this pilot study will yield unprecedented knowledge about PWAs' real-world experiences with anomia. If it is not feasible to obtain high-quality audio recordings from many participants, this pilot will still yield valuable knowledge regarding patients' ability to follow EMA/µEMA protocols and their perceived burden of EMA/µEMA.

Translational Significance This research is at the T1: From Bench to Bedside stage, given that the primary goal of this proposal is to evaluate the viability of EMA/µEMA as a novel assessment tool of language impairments in PWA. Translational potential is intrinsic to EMA/µEMA methods. The field of SLP lacks objective measures of communication deficits in real-life situations and the novelty and innovation of this work lies in working to remedy this problem. Findings from this study will inform a future NIH R01 application focused on verifying the criterion validity of EMA/µEMA in capturing anomia (in terms of accuracy, response rate, and naming error types) and determining the impact EMA/µEMA-based anomia has on participation and quality of life in PWA compared to traditional anomia assessment. If successful, these methods can be expanded to measure other language domains (e.g., single-word to phrase-level auditory or reading comprehension) with personalized tasks tailored to patients' needs. Information gleaned from this study and the NIH R01 work also will be used to develop in-situ, ""just-in-time"" ecological momentary interventions (EMI) for anomia in which smartwatch-delivered prompts can intervene each time a patient experiences an anomic moment. The NIH R01 proposal, EMA/µEMA work into expanded language domains, and development of ""just-in-time"" EMI for anomia constitute three future directions of this pilot that also fall at the T1: From Bench to Bedside stage of the translational continuum.

Therefore, in the future, the investigators will conduct research at the T2: From Bedside to Practice stage that will involve partnering with practicing SLPs and other healthcare professionals (e.g., physical and occupational therapists, physiatrists) at area rehabilitation hospitals or university-based clinics (e.g., Northeastern University Speech, Language, and Hearing Center) to conduct EMA/µEMA and EMI clinical trials in PWA. This work will yield vital information about the efficacy of these methods in real clinical practice. Successful completion of T1 and T2 phase studies also will pave the way for work at the level of T3: From Clinical Practice to Widespread Clinical Practice and Care Delivery. Research at the T3 stage is realistic for this line of work given that smart technology costs will likely continue to drop, making smartwatches and phones more accessible to more people, and the variety and flexibility of digital mobile health applications will continue to rise, resulting in potential widespread clinical use of EMA/µEMA and/or EMI protocols. Thus, this research will begin a translational path that ideally ends in implementation of EMA/µEMA and EMI into routine clinical care of aphasia that is reimbursable by insurance providers.

SPECIFIC AIMS The long-term goal of this line of research is to be able to reliably measure real-world language deficits in people with aphasia (PWA) with EMA/µEMA and to develop effective ""just-in-time"" interventions for PWA to improve their ease of everyday communication. As the first step towards this goal, the main objective of this proposal is to determine the relative feasibility of smartwatch-delivered micro-interaction ecological momentary assessment (µEMA) and traditional EMA as potential evaluation methods of aphasia. The secondary objective of this proposal is to determine which patient-specific factors (age, cognitive-linguistic deficit severity, and comfort with technology) are related to feasibility metrics.

Twenty PWA will participate in this pilot study, randomly assigned to the µEMA condition (n = 10) or traditional EMA condition (n = 10). In both the µEMA and traditional EMA protocols, the smartwatch will vibrate to alert the participant to a prompt to complete either a single picture naming trial (in the µEMA condition) or a set of picture naming trials (in the traditional EMA condition). After the vibration, the participant will see a ""Ready?"" screen in which they must press a YES button for the picture to appear, and then they will attempt to name the picture aloud. Participants in both conditions will be scheduled to complete 36 overt picture naming trials per day for three weeks. The only difference between conditions will be the trial delivery schedule: PWA in the µEMA condition will complete a single naming trial at a time, 36 times per day whereas PWA in the traditional EMA condition will receive four prompts per day to complete a set of nine picture naming trials per prompt. The two-fold rationale for comparing µEMA and traditional EMA protocols is that the investigators will be able to ensure the results reflect the viability of µEMA or traditional EMA specifically and not just the novelty of smartwatch use, and this approach will provide preliminary data regarding which method works best for which PWA.

As previously referenced, investigators will index feasibility in three ways. First, investigators will measure patients' adherence to the µEMA or traditional EMA schedule via two objective measures: compliance and completion. Because smartwatch µEMA/EMA has not been tested in PWA, investigators do not know PWAs' capacity for adhering to the protocol by pressing a button or providing a verbal response. Therefore, investigators will disentangle feasibility of button press responses to smartwatch-delivered µEMA/EMA from the feasibility of obtaining intelligible audio from the overt naming protocol. To do so, the YES/NO button tap responses to the ""Ready?"" screen will be used to calculate compliance. Similar to the investigators' prior work, compliance will be determined by considering the total number of YES button responses over the total number of scheduled prompts, including trials missed due to the watch being uncharged or turned off. On the other hand, completion will reflect PWAs' adherence to all smartwatch protocol steps, including pressing the YES button, seeing the picture(s), and attempting to name the picture(s) aloud. Therefore, completion will be calculated by considering the total number of naming attempts (indexed by the number of audio clips with an audible voice recording, disregarding intelligibility) over the total number of prompts delivered to the watch, excluding trials missed due to the watch being uncharged or off. Second, investigators will obtain patient-reported measures of perceived burden measured via Likert-scale questions on weekly surveys administered during weeks 2-4. Third, SLP graduate student RAs will code each picture naming audio clip as being either completely intelligible, partially intelligible, or completely unintelligible; this categorical speech intelligibility rating will provide a gross measure of feasibility of obtaining audio recordings of naming attempts in µEMA/EMA in PWA. With these data, investigators will address the following aims:

Aim #1: To compare feasibility measures (compliance, completion, perceived burden, and speech intelligibility) between the µEMA and traditional EMA conditions. Hypothesis: Based on the investigators' prior work, investigators predict PWA in the µEMA condition will demonstrate higher compliance and completion and report lower perceived burden than PWA in the traditional EMA condition. Investigators also predict that speech intelligibility will be greater in the µEMA condition than the traditional EMA condition because situational factors that disrupt recordings in a given moment (e.g., background noise, distance between the participant's mouth and the smartwatch) will be more likely to disrupt several trials in a row (as in the traditional EMA condition) than trials that are interspersed throughout the day (as in the µEMA condition).

Aim #2: To determine the extent to which patient-specific factors (age, cognitive-linguistic deficit severity, and comfort with technology) relate to feasibility measures. Hypothesis: Controlling for study condition, investigators predict that older age, more severe aphasia, worse non-linguistic cognitive skills (visuospatial and executive control abilities), and greater discomfort with technology will be associated with poorer compliance, lower completion, higher perceived burden, and poorer intelligibility of audio recordings during naming attempts across the entire group (n = 20 PWA).

RESEARCH PROCEDURES Approach Participants - Twenty adults with aphasia (18-89 years old) will complete the proposed protocol. Inclusion criteria will be: (1) current/pre-stroke English proficiency, (2) normal/corrected-to-normal vision and hearing, (3) medical stability, (4) history of left hemisphere stroke at least six months prior to enrollment, and (5) presence of aphasia as determined by consideration of scores on language assessments (e.g., Quick Aphasia Battery, discourse tasks) and the study team's clinical judgment (spearheaded by Dr. Meier). The reason for this two-pronged approach for determining aphasia presence is that widely-used comprehensive aphasia batteries are not reliably sensitive to mild aphasia, particularly for detecting less severe anomia. The exclusion criterion will be a history of neurological disease affecting the brain besides stroke.

Methodology - This study is for a longitudinal, controlled observational study. PWA will be randomly assigned to either a µEMA or traditional EMA condition.

Week 1: Participants will complete two, two-hour sessions: (1) an initial intake and evaluation session followed by (2) an EMA/µEMA protocol training session. Week 1, session 1 tests will include: (1) the Quick Aphasia Battery (QAB) to measure overall aphasia severity, (2) the Pattern Comparison Processing Speed Test and Flanker Inhibitory Control and Attention Test from the NIH Cognition Toolbox to measure non-linguistic visual attention and executive functions, respectively, (3) brief, standardized picture description and story elicitation tasks to index anomia in discourse, and (4) an overt object naming test to index word retrieval via a standard SLP assessment format (i.e., single administration in a quiet 1:1 interaction). The naming test will include normed real photos of the 260 items from the Snodgrass and Vanderwart stimuli set. PWA will also participate in an intake interview and complete a questionnaire about their comfort with technology, adapted for aphasia (simple language, short phrases) with responses scaled from 1 = strongly disagree to 7 = strongly agree. Due to their aphasia, PWA will require more training on using the smartwatch than neurotypical samples from prior µEMA/EMA studies. Thus, week 1, session 2 will focus on training activities, including:

Smartwatch Orientation: PWA will be oriented to the smartwatch (interface, charging, etc.) through simple verbal and written instructions and visual demonstrations.
EMA Task Training: PWA will be instructed on the specific EMA/µEMA naming task, including instructions on how to tap on the screen and the optimal approach for providing verbal responses (i.e., mouth close to the watch). Then, PWA will complete an 18-item traditional EMA-style naming task probe (i.e., several trials back-to-back on the smartwatch) in a quiet room in The Aphasia Network (TAN) Lab at Northeastern University. During this probe, SLP graduate student research assistants (RAs) will provide cueing and feedback so that PWA successfully learn how to operate the smartwatch and respond to prompts.
µEMA or EMA Protocol Simulation: PWA will complete a ""real-world"" µEMA or EMA task probe in a distracting environment (i.e., coffee shop or university bookstore on Northeastern's campus). For this final activity, over a 45-minute period, 18 smartwatch prompts will be given, either randomly interspersed with one naming trial per prompt (for PWA in the µEMA condition) or split into two sets of 9 trials per prompt (for PWA in the EMA condition). This final activity will mirror the week 2-4 µEMA/EMA protocols.

Weeks 2-4: PWA will complete either the µEMA or EMA protocol, depending on randomization. µEMA and EMA protocols will be delivered via a Fossil Sport Android smartwatch (or equivalent) provided by the study team. In each condition, the smartwatch will vibrate to alert PWA to a single naming trial (µEMA condition) or naming trial set (traditional EMA condition). After the vibration alert, PWA will see a screen that says ""Ready to name a picture?"" (µEMA condition) or ""Ready to name some pictures?"" (traditional EMA condition). If the participant taps YES, a picture will appear, and the device will begin recording audio. PWA will have up to five seconds to provide an oral response, after which a ""Thanks!"" screen will appear. The five-second response window was selected based on research showing that PWA correctly name pictures within 3.5 seconds, on average, with longer response latencies for incorrect responses. If a participant fails to respond to a vibration prompt or pushes the NO button to the ""Ready?"" screen, they will be re-prompted five minutes later via one more vibration alert.

During weeks 2-4, each participant will attempt to name 108 unique objects derived from the 260-item Snodgrass and Vanderwart photoset. The subset of pictures presented to each participant will be based on their naming evaluation (during week 1, session 1). When possible, half of the pictures will be items the PWA named correctly during the evaluation, and the other half will be incorrectly named pictures. This approach will allow us to gauge naming variability over time of items PWA are able versus unable to name during traditional SLP assessment, providing an important window into anomia. To mitigate practice effects, the individual pictures (µEMA condition) or picture sets (traditional EMA condition) will be presented randomly without replacement until all 108 pictures have been presented, and then the picture cycle will restart. In both conditions, 36 naming trials will be scheduled per day, resulting in a total of 756 scheduled trials for each participant across the experiment. In the µEMA condition, single-naming trial prompts will appear at random intervals from 10am to 8pm. In the EMA condition, PWA will receive four prompts per day to complete a set of nine picture naming trials per prompt; one prompt will be scheduled in every 2.5-hour block between 10am and 8pm.

Each night, participants will place the watch on a charger. Each morning, a smartphone provided by the study team will beep to alert the participant to take the smartwatch off the charger. The smartphone also will push the data collected by the smartwatch to the study team's server. At the end of each week, PWA will complete a 16-item survey about their µEMA/EMA experiences during the prior week. Surveys will be administered via Qualtrics and as needed, will be facilitated by SLP graduate student RAs via video conferencing software.

Week 5: In a final session at TAN Lab, PWA will return the smartwatch, complete the 260-item Snodgrass and Vanderwart picture naming test, and participate in a study exit interview. Family, friends, or care providers involved in assisting the PWA with any aspects of the protocol will also be asked to complete an exit interview.

Statistical Analyses - Aim #1: Investigators will code each trial in the µEMA or EMA time series to index compliance, completion, and speech intelligibility. Every scheduled trial (n = 756 total trials) will be coded as 0 for a non-response/NO button response or 1 for a YES button response, reflecting compliance. Every delivered trial with a naming attempt captured on audio (n trials will vary by person) will be coded as 0 for incomplete or 1 for complete, reflecting completion. Every audio clip (n trials will vary by person, depending on the number of naming attempts) will be coded as 0 for completely or partially unintelligible and 1 for completely intelligible, reflecting speech intelligibility. For each of these three measures, investigators will run a logistic mixed effects model with one of the feasibility measures (i.e., compliance, completion, or speech intelligibility) as the dependent variable, condition (µEMA or EMA) as the independent variable, and random effects of participant and trial. For perceived burden, investigators will collect responses on three questions/survey for three weeks. Given the small amount of data, survey responses will be plotted to visualize trends in increasing/decreasing burden rather than compared statistically.

Aim #2: Investigators will conduct a series of partial correlations between patient-specific factors and feasibility measures (compliance, completion, speech intelligibility, and perceived burden), controlling for study condition. Patient-specific factors will include age, aphasia severity (derived from the QAB), non-linguistic cognitive skills (averaged performance on the two NIH Toolbox tasks), and a summary score derived from the comfort with technology survey. Here, compliance will be the proportion of YES button responses divided by total scheduled trials (YESbutton/756) for each participant. Completion will be the proportion of naming attempts divided by total delivered trials (n naming attempts/n trials delivered). Speech intelligibility will be the proportion of completely intelligible responses divided by the total number of naming attempts (n completely intelligible trials/n naming attempts). Perceived burden will be calculated as the sum of all burden question Likert responses. Multiple comparison correction will be done at a false discovery rate of p < 0.05.

Sample size/power: For the Aim #1 logistic mixed effects models, two groups of 10 PWA per group will achieve 80% power to detect an odds ratio of 1.20 in a design of 756 repeated measures with a AR(1) covariance structure and when the correlation between observations of the same subject is 0.600 and alpha is 0.05. If the proportion of completed trials for the EMA group is 0.500, a statistically significant result will occur if the µEMA group proportion is 0.545 or greater. In Intille et al, the mean difference in proportions between the µEMA and EMA conditions was >0.20 for compliance and completion, which is much higher than the needed 0.045 difference. This suggests investigators will have ample power to detect significant differences between the two conditions. For Aim #2, to achieve 80% power with 20 participants and alpha at 0.05, Pearson correlation coefficients will need to be 0.59 or greater. Due to the small but feasible sample of this pilot, investigators may not achieve such effects, but these data will be critical for power calculations for the NIH R01. Further, investigators will have a wealth of information to describe qualitative trends in patient-specific factors, even if significance for Aim #2 is not achieved.","Aphasia Stroke Ecological Momentary Assessment Experience Sampling","Interventional","Inclusion Criteria:

The total treatment time will be equated in the two conditions.

Study participants will be housed locally at the Pittsburgh site at no cost and will be eligible to receive reimbursement for travel expenses. During the five-week treatment phase of the study, participants will receive 60 hours of SFA treatment with pre- and post-treatment assessment of their ability to name pictures of treated and untreated, semantically related nouns. Other secondary outcomes, including measures of connected speech and patient-reported communication ability will also be collected. In order to address unresolved questions about the underlying cognitive and neural mechanisms of SFA, participants will also receive concurrent pre- and post-treatment assessment of automatic word processing ability using eye-tracking methods and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Participants will also be asked to return to Pittsburgh for two days approximately 2-3 months later for follow-up language, eye-tracking, and fMRI testing.

The language testing results will be used to determine which version of SFA treatment optimizes outcomes. The eye-tracking results will be used to infer whether SFA's positive effects can be attributed to improved activation of lexical-semantic representations, improved ability to inhibit competing representations, or both. The fMRI results will be used to identify the brain networks and activation changes associated with changes in naming ability resulting from SFA.

It has been proposed that the co-occurrence of these impairments is due to a disruption of cognitive processes that support both abilities: maintenance of activated semantic and phonological representations of words, hereafter the 'activation--maintenance hypothesis'.

This hypothesis will be tested in the context of a treatment approach that aims to improve word processing and verbal STM abilities.","Based on research of word processing and verbal STM impairments in aphasia, it has been proposed that the co-occurrence of these impairments is due to a disruption of cognitive processes that support both abilities: maintenance of activated semantic and phonological representations of words, hereafter the 'activation--maintenance hypothesis'.

This hypothesis will be tested in the context of a treatment approach that aims to improve word processing and verbal STM abilities. Recently, the importance of treatment research has been emphasized as a critical testing ground for theories of language processing. Although it has been demonstrated that associations between impairments of word processing and reduced verbal STM capacity support the 'activation-maintenance hypothesis', direct treatments to improve the ability to maintain activation of word representations will serve as a stronger test of this hypothesis. First, empirical support will be established for the hypothesis that impairment to short-term maintenance of activated semantic and phonological representations of words impairs language and verbal STM abilities in aphasia and that direct treatment of this deficit will improve both abilities (Specific Aim 1). Second, the effects of this treatment will be compared under two administration conditions, high and low intensity (Specific aim 2). Finally, the neural regions associated with semantic STM and phonological STM will be investigated using voxel--based lesion--symptom mapping (Bates et al., 2003) (Specific Aim 3).

This research represents a unique attempt to apply more recent processing theories of aphasia to treatment of the disorder.The outcomes will have important implications for aphasia rehabilitation research.","","Interventional","Experimental participants:

Although the treatment appears promising, data to date do not permit an adequate assessment of the utility of the technique. The investigators propose to study the effects of TMS combined with Constraint Induced Language Therapy (CILT) in 75 subjects with chronic aphasia. Subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to TMS with CILT or sham TMS with CILT. One Hz TMS at 90% motor threshold will be delivered to the right inferior frontal gyrus for 20 minutes in 10 sessions over 2 weeks; language therapy will be provided for one hour immediately after the conclusion of each session of TMS. Change from baseline in the Western Aphasia Battery Aphasia Quotient at 6 months after the end of TMS treatment will serve as the primary outcome measure. A secondary aim is to identify anatomic and behavioral predictors of response to treatment. Finally, a third aim is to identify the mechanism underlying the beneficial effect of the treatment using a variety of imaging techniques. Subjects who have no contraindication to the MRI will undergo fMRI imaging prior to and at 6 months after therapy. Using modern network analyses and robust machine learning techniques, the investigators will identify changes in the strengths of connections between nodes in the language network to address specific hypotheses regarding the effects of TMS and CILT on brain organization that are associated with beneficial response to treatment.","TMS is a technique by which a brief electrical current is induced in brain tissue causing a brief suppression of the excitability of the underlying tissue; the technique, which was introduced in the 1980s and has been extensively used around the world, has been shown to transiently improve or disrupt specific cognitive operations. To achieve this end, a coil is positioned against the subject's head. The delivery of a single pulse begins with the discharge of current from a capacitor into a circular or figure-of-eight coil; this electrical current generates a brief magnetic field of up to 2.2 Tesla. As the pulse of electricity has a rise time of 0.2 ms. and a duration of 1 ms., the magnetic field changes in intensity quite rapidly. Because the magnetic field passes freely through the scalp, skull, and meninges, the flux in the magnetic field induces a small electric field in the brain that transiently alters neural activity.

TMS may be delivered in a variety of ways. The investigators propose to use 1 Hz TMS; that is, TMS pulses will be delivered at a frequency of 1/second. This style of TMS is assumed to be inhibitory in that it transiently suppresses the function of the cortex under the coil. Using the figure-of-eight coil to be employed here, TMS is thought to reduce activity in approximately 1 cubic cm. of cortex. Many investigators have employed TMS with a frequency of 1 Hz for periods of 20 minutes and longer; mild behavioral deficits are often present for several minutes in these studies.

The baseline phase will consist of 3 sessions, each lasting 1-2 hours depending on the stamina of the subject. The point of the baseline testing is to characterize the subject's language function. To that end, a number of standard language and neuropsychological tasks will be administered. These include the Western Aphasia Battery, Pyramids and Palm Trees test, Figural Fluency Test, word and non-word repetition tasks, the Nicholas and Brookshire Narratives, CILT stimulus naming, and Northwestern Assessment of Verbs and Sentences. Additionally, during the baseline, subjects will undergo MRI of the brain or, if they have a contraindication to MRI, a CAT scan of the head. No contrast will be used.

In the treatment phase, there will be 10 TMS sessions over 2 consecutive weeks in which 20 minutes (1200 pulses) of 1 Hz TMS at 90% motor threshold will be delivered to the inferior pars triangularis. Each TMS treatment session will be immediately followed by a 60-90 minute session of CILT

There will be two 3-month post-treatment visits and two 6-month post-treatment visits in which the full battery of language and cognitive assessments will be repeated. Subjects who are able to undergo MRI scanning will have anatomic and fMRI scans at the first 6-month post-treatment visit.

The investigators will pair TMS with CILT which has been shown to have positive outcomes in post-stroke aphasia. CILT invokes use-dependent learning in communicative interactions by requiring spoken output and restricting use of alternative forms of communication, such as gestures. The investigators will use a dual card-matching task modeled after Maher et al. As in the original CILT design, the participant interacts verbally with a conversational partner (here, the speech language pathologist), in turn requesting a card of given description and complying with the partner's request. In this way, the treatment targets both production and comprehension. Moreover, as verbal targets increase in linguistic complexity across the protocol (""a ball"", ""throw a ball""; ""Do you have a ball""?), a variety of lexical and phrasal structures are targeted. Studies of CILT have reported gains on multiple language behaviors, supporting its broad engagement of the language network.","","Interventional","Inclusion Criteria:

Of this group, about 30% suffer from aphasia. Aphasia is a speech-language disorder associated with exceptional difficulty performing daily communication activities. If no improvement is observed within the first months after the stroke, a complete recovery is unlikely, and the therapy can last for years.

Up to date, speech and language therapy is a standard of care for post-stroke aphasia, however the process is long and demanding.

In the past, several clinical trials aimed to verify the efficacy of language training paired with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), however recent meta-analysis indicates only possible effectiveness (Level C evidence) of anodal tDCS in chronic post-stroke aphasia.

To boost the effects of aphasia rehabilitation, effective brain stimulation protocol still needs to be developed.

Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) can be an interesting alternative to tDCS, as it is able to influence cortical excitability and activity.

Stimulation within high gamma oscillations (60-500Hz) might allow for better speech-language processing, as this band is considered to be the cognitive index of linguistic processes. Moreover, a short period of 75Hz tACS over the motor cortex suggested the positive impact of high-gamma tACS on brain plasticity.

The aim of this RCT is to determine whether 75Hz transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) paired with therapeutic linguistic tasks is an effective form of therapy for post-stroke aphasia, measured as an ability to name trained items at 12 weeks follow-up.","speech therapy brain stimulation communication language","Interventional","Individuals with aphasia (assessed using the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination) who perform the Naming Task in the range of 10%-60% accuracy will be included in the study.

After a stroke, networks between different areas of the brain can lose connection. In the case of aphasia, networks in the language areas of the brain are often disrupted. There is currently no ""fix"" to restore these specific language connections. However, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) might help the areas reconnect through alternative pathways.

TMS is a non-invasive procedure (in other words, it takes place outside your body). A coil will be placed over your head. The coil sends magnetic pulses to your brain to stimulate, or excite, neurons. Most studies using TMS stimulate one area of the brain at a time, but this does not tell us how to improve the network connections between brain areas.

For this study, we plan to stimulate two language areas of the brain to improve these network connections. To do this, we will use a form of TMS called ""cortico-cortical paired associative stimulation"" (ccPAS). This type of TMS involves applying paired pulses to two different brain areas that have been ""disconnected"" from each other after a stroke. The pulses are delivered with a time difference, on other words, one pulse after another.

The medical community cannot predict how well someone with aphasia will respond to treatment, as some people with aphasia are poor responders to intervention even when participating in empirically supported treatments. There is a strong likelihood that genetics play a role in language recovery after stroke, but very little research has been dedicated to investigating this link. This study will investigate whether two genes and cognitive abilities, such as memory, predict responsiveness to aphasia therapy for word-retrieval difficulties.","Incomplete understanding of patient-specific factors that determine whether someone will respond well to language therapy after stroke limits the development of methods to target or account for sources of variability. There is a strong likelihood that genetics play a role in language recovery after stroke, but very little research has been dedicated to investigating this link. The long-term goal of this line of work is to maximize response to aphasia therapy by incorporating patient-specific factors into decisions related to treatment planning. The overall objective of this application is to identify patterns of patient-specific factors including two candidate genes and cognitive skills that show a relationship with treatment outcomes. The central hypothesis is that there will be a relationship between ApoE and BDNF genotypes, and working memory on stimulus generalization. The rationale for the proposed project is that the identification of factors that impact treatment responsiveness will allow for better estimation of prognosis, improved triage of individuals into appropriate therapy regimens and direct targeting of cognitive factors to maximize behavioral gains. The two specific aims of the project are to determine the degree to which (1) ApoE and BDNF genotypes influence how individuals with aphasia respond to therapy, and (2) working memory abilities are related to stimulus acquisition and stimulus generalization after anomia therapy. Individuals with chronic post-stroke aphasia will undergo cognitive and language assessment, and provide a saliva sample for genetic analysis prior to participating in a cued picture-naming therapy for anomia. The expected outcomes are to integrate cognitive scores and genotypes for BDNF and ApoE into formulating probabilities of individual patient responsiveness to restorative therapy. Improvement in word retrieval abilities will be evaluated using the percentage of pictures named correctly. This contribution is expected to be significant because it will allow for more informed clinical decision making and better allocation of resources to appropriate treatments, thereby making advances in the field toward more personalized medicine, as opposed to a one-size-fits-all clinical approach.

Using a computer based speech and language therapy program, participants will practice conversational scripts that are either short or long. Participants will practice for either 2 weeks (5 days a week) or for 5 weeks (2 days a week).","Determining the optimal intensity of treatment is essential to the design and implementation of any treatment program for aphasia. Yet, treatment intensity is a complex construct and information on the variables modulating it remain ambiguous and limited. Studies reported in the neuroscience and clinical literature support the need for intensive treatment to induce long-term neuroplastic changes while the cognitive psychology literature suggests that learning is best maintained with distributed schedules. A few studies have looked at dose parameters for single word naming tasks, but there is limited evidence regarding dose parameters for treatments that focus on training the production of larger units, such as sentences or even connected discourse. One approach that is frequently used clinically and has evidence for its efficacy is script training. Little is currently known regarding the optimum dose of script training (i.e., the number of repetitions over time of each sentence within the script) that is required to promote the best outcomes.

This study investigates the effects of modulating stimulus variables, specifically stimulus practice distribution and stimulus repetition. We use a baseline script treatment that has experimental support regarding its efficacy, and that allows the manipulation of these variables. To ensure independence and fidelity, treatment is provided in a controlled computer environment (desktop and tablet). To avoid clinician-related variables such as expertise and personality factors that may influence treatment, sentences are modeled during treatment by an anthropomorphic agent with high visual speech intelligibility and affective expressions.

With regard to ""best outcomes"", generalization is the ultimate goal of any treatment approach. Therefore, the primary outcome is a generalization measure of conversation. Secondary measures address short-term acquisition, longer-term maintenance, and stimulus and response generalization for assessing gain over baseline, differential effects, and interactions. A mobile-connected wireless wearable laryngeal sensor allows tracking of talk time at home and in the community as a measure of treatment effectiveness and transfer. For privacy, it does not record audio.

Results and computational models of learning (generalization, short-term acquisition, and longer-term maintenance) will contribute new evidence to fill critical gaps in current scientific understanding regarding the effectiveness and clinical application of aphasia treatment approaches. More generally, findings will help to inform clinical practice and treatment of neurologic communication disorders; the virtual clinician guided intervention that the proposal develops has the potential to reduce costly clinician-client time otherwise required for long-term rehabilitation.","Stroke Speech and Language Therapy Speech and Language Treatment Communication Disorders Language Disorders","Interventional","Inclusion Criteria:

More than 20% of stroke patients suffered from language impairment. The recovery of language dysfunction after stroke is highly variable. Some patients recover spontaneously in the early phases of stroke, but about two thirds of patients never fully restore language ability. The purpose of this study was to explore the intervention effect of high definition transcranial alternating current stimulation in chronic post-stroke aphasia.

40 patients with language disorder diagnosed by the Aphasia Battery of Chinese (ABC) were recruited from the first affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University. All participants underwent a structured interview and routine laboratory examination before and after receiving HD-tACS. After meeting the inclusion criteria and obtaining informed consent, each participant will complete the clinical evaluation, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and HD-tACS treatment conducted by trained researchers at the Neuropsychological Synergetic Innovation Center of Anhui Medical University.

All the participants were randomized (1:1) to receive ""real"" or ""sham"" treatment protocol. Stimulation electrodes were arranged in a 4 × 1 ring configuration at F1, F2, C1 ,C2 and FCz, with the central one delivering an alternating current 2 mA and the surrounding 4 electrodes delivering one-fourth of the central electrode's current in the opposite polarity. The average peak-to-peak stimulation intensity across participants was 2 mA for the 6-Hz tACS. In the sham condition, 6-Hz tACS was delivered only during the ramp-up and ramp-down periods (30 s); no current was delivered during the 30-minute intervention. The tACS stimulation lasted 30 minutes, a duration that is common in cognitive neuroscience research.

Aphasia impacts language production and comprehension as well as reading and writing. The ramifications of aphasia extend beyond language impairment to negatively impacting a person's social, vocational, and recreational activities. Currently, the most effective way to treat aphasia is with speech-language therapy (SLT). However, even if SLT is intensive, persons with aphasia are left with residual language delays. Recent research suggests that pairing SLT with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) a non-invasive, safe, low-cost form of brain stimulation may aid language recovery in persons with aphasia. However, results from tDCS studies are inconclusive. The success of tDCS in combination with SLT could depend on the timing of tDCS since tDCS-induced effects depend on the neuronal state of the brain-networks at the time of the stimulation. In this study, the differential impact of tDCS before behavioral SLT (offline-before therapy), tDCS after SLT (offline-after therapy), and tDCS concurrently with SLT (online) on functional language recovery in persons with aphasia will be investigated. Sham tDCS (i.e., SLT alone) as a control group will also be included in the study. The investigators hypothesize that both offline and online tDCS will improve language functioning than sham tDCS.","tDCS Implementation:

2mA of direct current for 20 minutes will be delivered using a constant current stimulator via two electrodes in saline soaked sponges. To stimulate the left angular gyrus, a cathodal electrode inside a saline soaked sponge (5 x 3cm) will be placed over the CP5 according to the 10-20 international system for EEG electrode placement. The electrodes will be secured in position by a custom-built EEG cap that will be marked with the location for angular gyrus. The investigators will then confirm that the cathodal electrode is over the left angular through the use of neuronavigation. The ""return"" anode electrode will be placed in a saline soaked sponge (5 x 5cm) on the center of the supraorbital region.

At the beginning of the tDCS, current will slowly ram-up during the first few seconds until it reaches 2mA. The ramp-up process will acclimate the participants to tDCS-induced sensations (e.g., itching). At the end of the tDCS sessions, current will slowly ramp down in the last few seconds to 0mA. The total duration of the 2mA current will be maintained for 20 minutes. For sham stimulation, the investigators will place the electrodes in the same location as the real tDCS groups with stimulation ending after few seconds. The brief stimulation will produce tDCS-induced sensations so that participants will not be aware when the tDCS stopped delivering direct current

Speech-Language Treatment:

Standard-of-care treatment - script training will be used to provide SLT to our participants. The treatment will be delivered via a computer program, Aphasia Scripts ®, whereby a virtual therapist interactively guides the participants through treatment steps. Scripts will be five to ten sentences and developed from common templates about topics relevant to daily life (e.g., asking questions at the grocery store, ordering in a restaurant). The advantage of using a computer program instead of a human therapist is that it removes extraneous variables associated with human therapists (e.g., different levels of encouragement) and this, together with the use of script templates, ensures treatment fidelity across participants.

Duration of an individual subject's participation in the study:

Subjects will be requested to come for baseline sessions (3 to 4 hours) before the actual experiment. The baseline assessments may be done over two visits. In the baseline session the subjects' aphasia severity will be assessed. The participants will also perform baseline tasks of language and cognition in this session. Subjects will then participate in 3 weeks of tDCS and SLT (i.e., 15 sessions). The sessions will consist of 40 minutes of SLT and 20 minutes of tDCS. Subjects will be asked to return for an assessment immediately following the end of treatment and for follow-up testing after 4 and 8 weeks. Therefore, total number of visits will be 19-23 sessions (depending on how many visits are needed for the assessments) over a period of three months.","Aphasia, tDCS, Script training, Functional language, Naming","Interventional","Inclusion Criteria:

This proof-of-concept study is the first to evaluate the direct effect of speech entrainment practice on independent speech. Thus, the effect size for accurate power estimation is not known. The strategy for this study is to optimize experimental sensitivity by maximizing the number of observations per participants per condition within the constraints of feasibility. The results from this study will provide critical information for evaluating the effect size for a subsequent phase. Nevertheless, to estimate an optimal sample size, the investigators leveraged the data from our Pilot Study, which examines the speech entrainment effect on immediate performance rather than learning. With 13 participants, the investigators estimated 80% power to detect the effect of 0.8 (mean difference between groups divided by the pooled standard deviation) observed in our pilot study for speaking with audiovisual speech entrainment vs. independent speech (Aim 1). The calculation is based on a paired t-test with an alpha of .05 (two-tailed) and a correlation of 0.5 between groups. With 24 participants, there is 80% power to detect the observed effect of 0.6 for speaking with audiovisual speech entrainment vs. auditory-only speech entrainment (alpha is set to .05, two-tailed, correlation between groups is .57; Aim 2b). The investigators have substantially increased the sample size (N=40) with the consideration that learning effects (the focus of the present study) are expected to be smaller than performance effects (the focus of the Pilot Study).","","Interventional","Inclusion Criteria:

And if these changes can be related to neuroplastic change in the cerebellar cortical pathway indirectly measured through neurophysiologic changes using spectral electroencephalogram (EEG). The initial phase includes the proposed pilot study data from which will be used to inform a larger clinical trial. The primary aims of this pilot are to 1) determine the effect of combining cerebellar tDCS with constraint-induced language therapy (CILT) on language as measured by a verbal fluency task and discourse task in a small population and 2) identify the tolerance of the intervention and barriers to participation measured by the adverse events questionnaire that will inform the methodology of a larger study. The secondary aims include estimating the size of the treatment effect on 1) delta percentage in F3, F7 and Fp1 compared to F4, F8, and Fp2 using resting state EEG spectral analysis and coherence, 2) working memory as measured by the score on the n-back test and 3) quality of life as measured by the Stroke Aphasia Quality of Life survey tool. The secondary aims will be used to determine the utility of these measures in a larger clinical trial.

This is a prospective, crossover study, sham-controlled intervention study with two intervention conditions delivered across 6 intervention sessions (3x/week for two weeks) with a 4-week washout in between. Conditions include: 1) sham cerebellar tDCS and 2) real cerebellar tDCS delivered at 2mA across 20 minutes. Each of these will be delivered during CILT intervention with a licensed, certified speech-language pathologist trained in CILT. Once tDCS stimulation has ended, CILT will continue to be delivered for an additional 25 minutes. Assessments of discourse, verbal fluency, working memory and EEG spectral analysis will be conducted at four timepoints, before and after each intervention phase.","This is a prospective sham-controlled, cross-over design. Eligible participants must be over the age of 18 years, be > least 6 months post unilateral cortical stroke and diagnosed with mild to moderate non-fluent aphasia. Additional inclusion/exclusionary criteria have been specified in and approved by the IRB. Six to seven participants are expected to be recruited and screened, with the goal to enroll and complete the study with four individuals who will be randomly assigned to receive either sham or real condition first. The two intervention conditions include: 1) andodal tDCS (2mA) to the right posterior-lateral cerebellum and 2) sham tDCS to the right posterior-lateral cerebellum. The participants will receive 20 minutes of tDCS (sham or real) during CILT followed by an additional 25 minutes of CILT alone. Each condition will be administered 3 days per week for two weeks for a total of 6 intervention sessions with a 4-week washout period between.

For tDCS (TCT-Research Version tDCS Stimulator, Hong Kong), two 5x5 saline-soaked sponge electrodes will be used with the anode placed over the right cerebellar hemisphere; 1cm under and 4cm lateral of the inion targeting the posterior lateral cerebellum and the cathode will be placed on the right shoulder. The electrode placement will be the same across both conditions. The CILT behavioral intervention will be led by a certified, licensed speech-language pathologist and a graduate student researcher and will follow the guidelines of CILT.","transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) aphasia constraint-induced language therapy (CILT)","Interventional","Inclusion Criteria:

It is not well understood why and how this technique works. One goal of this study is to determine who benefits from speaking in unison, and what characteristics of speech are most helpful. Another goal is to investigate a possible mechanism for this benefit: why does speaking in unison help? A possible mechanism for this benefit is examined, by testing whether the degree of alignment of a person's speech with that of another speaker can account for unison benefit.","Aphasia is an acquired language disorder, most commonly due to stroke. It can affect an individual's ability to speak, understand spoken language, read, and write. Many treatments designed to improve spoken language in persons with aphasia (PWAs) use unison speech, having the person with aphasia speak along with the clinician or with a recording. One goal of this study is to determine who benefits from speaking in unison, and what characteristics of speech help them the most. Another goal is to investigate a possible mechanism for this benefit: why does speaking in unison help? This knowledge is important because understanding who benefits from this commonly used and potentially powerful therapy component, under which conditions they benefit, and why they do, is critical for customizing therapy so it can be as effective and efficient as possible. Unison speech is conducted using one of two different timing patterns: (1) a natural conversational pattern, which is used in everyday conversations, or (2) a metrical pattern, which follows a beat-based timing framework, as in songs or some poems. In either case, precisely aligning one's speech with that of another person (i.e., entraining one's speech) requires prediction: each speaker must plan their own speech motor commands before having heard the other speaker say the words they are planning. Natural conversational timing requires the speaker to make use of knowledge about language, particularly grammar, to align with the other person. In contrast, a metrical pattern allows a speaker to predict speech timing without relying heavily on language-based knowledge. Given that many PWAs have impaired grammar, we hypothesize that most PWAs will benefit more from speaking in unison to sentences with metrical vs. conversational timing patterns. However, there is great variation in linguistic, motor speech, and timing skills across PWAs, so metrical and conversational timing patterns are likely to have different degrees of effectiveness for different individuals. Results from this study will demonstrate how individual characteristics and speech timing affect whether or not a person with aphasia benefits from speaking in unison. Results will also indicate whether a speaker's ability to predict speech timing is necessary for a benefit of unison speech. Prediction ability will be measured by how closely the speaker aligns their speech with a spoken model.","","Interventional","Inclusion Criteria:

Because all PWA have word retrieval deficits, this project will test if greater language gains can be achieved by supplementing anomia intervention with excitatory brain stimulation to the left hemisphere and will evaluate associated functional brain changes to aid the optimization of neural reorganization to facilitate language processing.","Aphasia is a language impairment that commonly occurs following brain damage (e.g., stroke). While language rehabilitation can yield improved language functioning, treatment outcomes vary greatly across individuals. In chronic aphasia, language gains occur through the brain's inherent ability to reorganize (i.e., neuroplasticity).

While Speech-language therapy (SLT) can target various language skills and modalities, the most pervasive deficit across all persons with aphasia (PWA) is difficulty with word finding. Thus, aphasia treatment often includes some form of intervention focused on improving naming abilities. As with language function in general, naming abilities in PWA seems to be associated with left hemisphere recruitment, particularly with the viable tissue at the rim of the lesion (perilesional areas). This project investigates an innovative approach to improving current therapy by examining the benefits of using excitatory transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) stimulation/neuromodulation during anomia treatment (i.e. word-finding treatment).

This study investigates an innovative approach to improving current therapy by examining the benefits of using excitatory tDCS stimulation/neuromodulation during anomia treatment.

The aims of this study are as follows:

Aim 1. To investigate the benefits of using broad transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to improve word retrieval in persons with aphasia (PWA). Aim 2. To study functional brain changes related to this treatment. Aim 3. To examine behavioral and neural re-organization correlates related to treatment outcomes.

Approximately 180,000 new cases of aphasia are identified per year, and approximately 1 million or 1 in 250 are living with aphasia in the United States (NIH-NIDCD, 2015). Treatments are limited and provide modest benefits at best. The current emphasis in aphasia rehabilitation is to formulate intensive speech and language therapies and augment therapeutic benefits by providing brain stimulation concurrent with therapies. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is one of the most widely used such technique. While tDCS has had relative success in chronic aphasia (>6 months after stroke), it has not been efficacious during subacute stages (<3 months after stroke). But enhancing language recovery early after stroke is desirable because of its potential impact on long-term language outcomes and quality-of-life.

The current study will investigate the efficacy of high-definition tACS (HD-tACS) to help restore neural oscillatory activity in aphasia. TACS differs from tDCS in that sinusoidal, alternating currents are delivered rather than constant currents. TACS can manipulate the ongoing oscillatory neuronal activity and potentially increase functional synchronization (or connectivity) between targeted areas. This feature of tACS is quite attractive, given the new body of evidence suggesting that language impairments stem from diminished functional connectivity and disruptions in the language network due to stroke. The selection of tACS frequencies in this study is guided by our preliminary work examining pathological neural oscillations found near stroke-lesioned areas (or perilesional) in aphasia. By exogenously tuning the perilesional oscillations with tACS, the investigators hope to up-regulate communication across these areas and other connected areas to improve language outcome. If successful, tACS will be a powerful and novel treatment approach with reverberating positive impact on long-term recovery.

The study will employ HD-tACS in a within-subject and sham-controlled design, using two frequencies (alpha/10 Hz and low-gamma/40 Hz) combined with language tasks and electroencephalography (EEG) to evaluate subsequent behavioral and neurophysiological changes. Investigators plan to recruit 50 participants: 25 stroke survivors with aphasia at lease 1 month after stroke, and 25 healthy controls.

Participants will complete language testing that covers a broad range of language functions, medical history, and MRI. Eligible participants will undergo active tACS at 10 Hz or 40 Hz, or sham-tACS. All participants will receive all three stimulation types during separate visits. The tACS administrator and participants will be blinded to the stimulation type. The order of stimulation type will be counterbalanced across participants. Washout period between visits will be at least 48 hours to minimize potential carryover effects. EEG will be acquired before and after tACS during periods of rest (resting-state) and during language tasks. Participants will complete a questionnaire at the end of stimulation visits to assess potential side effects of tACS. Total time enrolled in the study is expected to be 2-3 weeks, which may be longer depending on participant's availability.","language language impairment transcranial alternating current stimulation tACS","Interventional","Inclusion Criteria:

Furthermore, in Sweden, as well as in several other countries, access to speech-language therapy is limited. The purpose of this clinical trial is to compare outcome from Verb Network Strengthening Treatment (VNeST) provided as In-Clinic therapy (I-CT) or as synchronous telepractice therapy (TP-T).","Every year thousands of persons in Sweden suffer from brain damage resulting in anomia, that is, word finding difficulties affecting their ability to talk to other people. Anomia is one of the most common and persistent symptoms of aphasia following a left hemisphere stroke, but it is also common in in progressive neurological diseases such as Parkinson's disease or multiple sclerosis (MS). There is evidence that more intensive speech language therapy may improve speech even in a chronic (> six month post stroke) phase of aphasia. However, access to the necessary amount of speech language therapy is limited due to lack of financial resources as well as to limitations to service providers in more rural areas.

It has been suggested that telepractice may increase the access to speech-language therapy for more people but there is a lack of knowledge of whether there is a difference in outcome from interventions provided as In-Clinic therapy (I-CT) or as telepractice therapy (TP-T).

Verb Network Strengthening Treatment (VNeST) is an anomia therapy focused on the production of short phrases. The participants generate thematically related verbs and nouns to strengthen the neural connections between the action (verb) and related thematic roles (agents and patients). From orally and written stimuli, the participants are asked to tell whom (subject) may do something (verb) with what (object) and then to do short expansions from this basic phrase. So far, results from single-case experimental design studies performed by Edmonds and colleagues are promising, showing generalization of outcomes to untrained items. Moreover, improvement in word finding was observed in other tasks like object and verb naming as well as sentence production and partly to connected speech.

The present project explores the effectiveness of VNeST, first in a small pilot study, then in a clinical trial including 80 participants. Participants with left hemisphere aphasia will be randomized to either an in-clinic therapy (I-CT) group or a telepractice therapy (TP-T) group and provided VNeST following the same treatment protocol based on Edmonds (2014).

The instigators' method is based on the reinforcement of the interaction between perceptual and motor representations, thanks to the innovative Ultraspeech device. The investigators will exploit a fundamental psycholinguistic principle, which postulates that speech is based both on the activation of the system controlling the motricity of effectors related to word articulation (action) and on the auditory or visual representation of words (perception).

Aphasia treatments include speech and language therapy and pharmacologic therapy, but several studies have found that these treatments are not completely effective for patients with aphasia, leaving them with residual deficits that significantly add to the cost of stroke-related care. Additionally, the amount and frequency of speech and language therapy delivered may have a critical effect on recovery. Therefore, there is a need for new treatments or adjuncts to existing treatments, such as brain stimulation interventions, that have the potential to show greater improvements in patients with aphasia.

Previous studies using HD-tDCS have shown the effectiveness of this stimulation technique for enhancing language recovery in patients with aphasia.

However, language processes are not determined solely by local neural activity at a single site, but rather by the interaction between neural networks. This is because a large cortical network is involved in language processes and, therefore, the same language disorder may result from lesions at different locations in this network.

The investigators hypothesize that anodal HD-tDCS will enhance neural interactions between language areas and, thereby, improve language processing and word learning.

The investigators propose to carry out a study on chronic aphasic patients involving HD-tDCS of the Broca region (left inferior frontal gyrus) combined with a verb learning task.","Functional connectivity (FC) represents a means of analyzing functional interactions in the brain network by assessing the statistical dependence of neural activity between brain areas. The brain maintains a high level of interactions between brain areas even in the resting state, when it is not explicitly involved in a specific task. Resting-state interactions occur mainly in the so-called alpha frequency band (8-13 Hz) . Moreover, these resting-state interactions are crucial for correct task performance and learning. Indeed, healthy subjects with high resting-state alpha-band FC levels are better able to perform tasks and learn. For example, subjects with high levels of FC between Broca's area and the rest of the brain perform better on language production tasks and show greater training gains when learning new words. In addition, patients with brain damage due to stroke show a reduction in resting-state alpha-band FC, which correlates with the severity of neurological deficits. In particular, a loss of FC of structurally preserved inferior frontal areas was associated with more severe aphasia. Conversely, high-levels of FC between the inferior frontal brain areas and the rest of the brain during the first weeks after stroke was associated with better recovery from aphasia, probably reflecting a reorganization of neural connections as a neural mechanism involved in plasticity. Resting-state FC is therefore an interesting neural target for therapy, which could help improve recovery from aphasia.

In a previous study on healthy subjects, the investigators have indeed observed that HD-tDCS applied to Broca's area improves the ability for new-verb learning, i.e., the correct naming of action pictures. This improvement in learning correlated with greater increase in FC between Broca's and Wernicke's area.

Spatial-motor-sensory problems limit functioning and independence, which is costly to Veterans, their families, and society. Currently, spatial-motor-sensory problems are targeted using different treatments. However, there is a treatment that has shown promise in simultaneously targeting spatial function, motor function and pain in right-brain stroke. The investigators propose to investigate the feasibility of using adapted spatial-motor sensory assessment and treatment procedures for Veterans with left-brain stroke who have language and cognitive impairment. The next step will be to conduct a large-scale study focused on this multi-target treatment for more efficient and effective stroke rehabilitation. The investigators expect this line of research to increase functioning, independence and quality of life in Veteran stroke survivors.","The functional disability experienced by Veterans after stroke, and the limited rehabilitation resources available, highlight the importance of identifying feasible treatments acting on more than one recovery target. Currently, there are separate and modality-specific treatment pathways for cognitive and motor impairments. These modality-specific treatment pathways lead to fragmentation of care, and under-identification and under-treatment of invisible disabilities, such as spatial neglect, aphasia and pain. The result is longer hospital stays, greater risk of falls, and poor functional outcomes. Employing a treatment that simultaneously addresses multiple targets will ensure that the investigators provide the needed care for >50% of post-stroke Veterans who have both visible and invisible disabilities, during the critical post-acute period of recovery.

Prism adaptation treatment (PAT) is a 10-day regimen reported to be inexpensive, replicable and effective for treatment of spatial neglect, and studies have demonstrated that it also enhances everyday activities and motor recovery and reduces chronic post-stroke pain in patients with right brain stroke. Additionally, brain mapping methods have shown that in patients with right brain stroke, those with frontal lesions respond optimally to PAT. No studies have investigated PAT in left-brain stroke patients with language and cognitive impairment. To address this research gap, the investigators will address the following aims:

Aim 1: To demonstrate the feasibility of adapted PAT procedures in patients with aphasia and memory impairment. .

Aim 2: To demonstrate the feasibility of adapted methods for assessing spatial and motor function and pain in patients with aphasia and memory impairment.

Aim 3: To demonstrate the feasibility of using information about lesion location from the radiology report to classify frontal vs. nonfrontal lesions.","aphasia spatial neglect rehabilitation","Interventional","Inclusion Criteria:

The investigators are also studying how inflammation is related to the symptoms that first occur in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). For this reason, the investigators are asking people with different versions of Alzheimer's disease to participate. This includes patients with either:

Posterior cortical atrophy - a version of Alzheimer's disease with vision difficulties
Logopenic variant primary progressive aphasia - a version of Alzheimer's disease with language difficulties
Amnestic Alzheimer's disease - a ""typical"" version of Alzheimer's disease with memory difficulties
The investigators are also enrolling older adults with normal visual, language, and memory function.","This study is being done to learn about inflammation in Alzheimer's disease so that the investigators can find out new ways to treat patients with this disease. Because Alzheimer's disease usually causes slow changes to the brain over time, in this study the investigators are going to perform different tests and then repeat some of them two years later.

Inflammation can be measured using a type of brain scan called a positron emission tomography (PET) scan. A PET scan uses very small amounts of a radioactive drug that is injected into a vein to create a special picture of the brain. The inflammation PET scan uses a drug called ER176. ER176 is an experimental drug but has been used in several human studies before. Once in the body, ER176 sticks to areas with lots of inflammation, and the PET scan allows us to see these areas.

Inflammation can also be measured by looking at certain proteins in the spinal fluid. In order to measure these proteins in the spinal fluid, the investigators need to perform a lumbar puncture (spinal tap). Certain genes that inherited from parents influence the amount of inflammation in the body. The investigators can study how genes affect inflammation in Alzheimer's disease by looking doing genetic tests on blood that collected from the vein.

The investigators can study how genes affect inflammation in Alzheimer's disease by doing genetic tests on blood. The investigators will also be testing blood for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)- CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) antibodies. The investigators want to see if exposure to the virus that causes COVID-19 changes the amount of inflammation in the brain or not.

Along with inflammation, Alzheimer's disease is also associated with the build up of the proteins amyloid and tau in the brain. The investigators can measure these proteins using PET scans. The amyloid PET scan uses a drug called florbetaben that has been approved by the FDA to help diagnose Alzheimer's disease. The tau PET scan uses a drug called MK-6240. Like ER176, MK-6240 is experimental but has been used in several human studies before.

A brain MRI creates a high resolution picture of the brain. The brain MRI helps the investigators get more information from the PET scans, and can also tell the investigators the size and appearance of different brain structures. When someone has Alzheimer's disease, some of these brain structures get smaller or have altered appearance on MRI.","Inflammation PET scans Cognitive Impairment Posterior Cortical Atrophy Logopenic Variant Primary Progressive Aphasia Amnestic Alzheimer's Disease MK-6240","Interventional","Inclusion criteria:

Age 50 and over at time of screening.
At screening, must have no cognitive impairment, or meet criteria for amnestic Alzheimer's disease, posterior cortical atrophy, or logopenic variant primary progressive aphasia. Diagnoses will be made based on history, exam, neuropsychological testing, brain MRI, and consensus diagnosis.
Patients must have Clinical Dementia Rating scale score of 0.5 or 1 at enrollment. Controls must have Clinical Dementia Rating scale score of 0 at enrollment.
Subjects unable to provide informed consent must have a surrogate decision maker.
Written and oral fluency in English.
Able to participate in all scheduled evaluations and to complete all required tests and procedures.
In the opinion of the PI, the subject must be considered likely to comply with the study protocol and to have a high probability of completing the study.

Exclusion criteria:

Past or present history of a brain disorder other than Alzheimer's disease (including presence of cortical infarct on MRI even in absence of clinical stroke).
Serious medical conditions, which make study procedures of the current study unsafe. Such serious medical conditions include uncontrolled epilepsy and multiple serious injuries.
Contraindication to MRI scanning.
Conditions precluding entry into the scanners (e.g. morbid obesity, claustrophobia, etc.).
Exposure to research related radiation in the past year that, when combined with this study, would place subjects above the allowable limits.
Participation in the last year in a clinical trial for a disease modifying drug for AD.
Taking immunosuppressive medication (e.g., glucocorticoids, cytostatics, antibodies, drugs acting on immunophilins, interferons, tumor necrosis factor inhibitors).
