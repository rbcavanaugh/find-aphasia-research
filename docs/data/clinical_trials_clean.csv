"1",1,"Conversation Group Treatment for Aphasia: Does it Work?","Aphasia, Acquired","April 15, 2022","NCT05113160","Boston University Charles River Campus Boston Massachusetts United States","Boston University Charles River Campus","Recruiting","The proposed research will test the efficacy of group conversation treatment for people with aphasia and explore whether the effects of treatment differ as a result of the following factors:

Group size: Do large groups of 6-8 people with aphasia or dyads of 2 people with aphasia demonstrate different levels of improvement with this treatment?
Group composition: Do effects of conversation group treatment differ if the groups include members with similar or different types of aphasia?
Aphasia severity: Do effects of conversation group treatment differ if the individuals within the group have mild-moderate or moderate-severe profiles of aphasia?

Treatment sessions will occur in groups of 6-8 people with aphasia or with 2 people with aphasia. During treatment sessions, discourse will be facilitated on a focused set of every day topics, such as current events or travel. Linguistic and multi modal cueing hierarchies will be tailored to individual client goals and used to maximize communication success.

The prediction is that conversation treatment is an effective method for improving communication in people with aphasia, but that specific benefits may differ based on variables such as group size, group composition, and aphasia severity. The results will help inform best practices for aphasia treatment and refine a hypothesized model about the mechanisms underlying conversation treatment.","Aphasia is a language disorder that affects approximately two million Americans. The communication barriers associated with aphasia limit the ability to return to work and hobbies, worsen social relationships, and lead to social isolation. Social isolation is correlated with many negative health outcomes, including mortality. As a result, the consequences of aphasia can be wide reaching and severe. Group treatment has the potential to improve communication and reduce social isolation, while also reducing medical costs. However, this treatment format lacks a strong evidence base.

This research uses a hypothesis-driven approach to test the efficacy of conversation treatment and develop and refine a mechanistic pathway of how conversation treatment leads to behavioral changes in communication ability. We will systematically explore whether the effects of treatment differ as a result of number of participants (large group or dyad), group composition (heterogenous versus homogenous profiles of aphasia), and severity of aphasia. The study will enroll a total of 168 participants with aphasia across three sites. In cycle one, 72 participants will be randomly assigned to one of three conditions: dyad treatment, traditional group treatment or delayed control group. In cycles two and three, 48 participants with severe aphasia and 48 participants with mild-moderate aphasia will be randomly assigned to either large group or dyad conditions. In all cycles, treatment will occur for 60 minutes, twice per week for 10 weeks.

During treatment sessions, a speech pathologist will facilitate discourse on a focused set of salient topics, such as current events, using individualized, linguistic and multimodal cueing hierarchies. The primary outcome measure is a functional measure of communication (Aphasia Communication Outcome Measure, ACOM; Hula et al., 2015). Secondary outcome measures will include standardized tests and patient reported outcome measures, and examine linguistic and functional communication abilities. All participants will be assessed pre-, post-, 4 weeks post- and 12 weeks post-treatment.

The proposed research will address the following specific aims. Specific Aim 1 is to examine efficacy of conversation treatment delivered in dyads and large groups compared to a delayed-treatment control group. Specific Aim 2 is to determine optimal parameters for conversation treatment by testing whether the treatment effects differ as a function of aphasia severity (2A) or group composition (2B). Specific Aim 3 will test a hypothesized model of the pathway by which conversation treatment effects behavioral change. The results will provide further efficacy for conversation treatment and inform about the optimal parameters and outcomes of this intervention.

Changes are studied following intensive treatment of aphasia and AOS with standardised speech-language testing and testing of communication and with voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis and resting state functional connectivity (rsFC).","This study explores structural and functional brain changes in relation to effects on speech, language, communication and quality of life following an intensive speech-language program with additional physiotherapy for persons with chronic aphasia and/or apraxia of speech. The participants are consecutively recruited from a rehabilitation centre providing intensive treatment for chronic conditions following stroke or other neurological injuries. The speech-language pathologists (SLPs) involved in the rehabilitation programs perform the testing directly before and after intensive intervention with an additional follow up after 16 weeks (+-2) with testing of speech-language, communication and quality of life. The SLPs have more than five years of experience of working with aphasia and are specialised in working with intensive treatment, they have acquired in-depth knowledge on how to evaluate and treat aphasia and apraxia of speech in lectures and workshops. The test procedure is recorded with camcorder and voice recorder to provide the opportunity to access data retrospectively and to minimize bias by including an external SLP who makes a second blinded evaluation on randomized participants' performance in ASRS, BNT and CAT by studying the video and voice material. Structural and functional neuroplasticity is also investigated with voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis, resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) in domain-specific (language processing) and domain-general (executive and attention processing). This intensive neuro-rehabilitation program for speech and language deficits named Multimodal Intensive Rehabilitation for Aphasia and Apraxia of Speech (MIRAA) is defined as an ICAP (Intensive Comprehensive Aphasia Program) with focus on both speech and language function and communicative activity and participation. The program is intensive: consisting of ten days of training (5 hours/day), with a minimum of three hours dedicated to speech and language rehabilitation with additional physical therapy. The program includes both individual treatment, group therapy and computer-based therapy. The therapy is individually set up after the participant's goals together with the team including SLPs, physiotherapists and a board-certified neurologist and/or specialist in rehabilitation medicine. The goals are set by the participants, family members and clinicians the first day of the program. The participant and their significant other are offered education with the aim to enhance the knowledge on communication, the key concepts of neuroplasticity and other functions and strategies important in everyday life. The treatment methods being used are evidence-based and/or widely used multimodal programs covering the need for extensive training programs targeting both impairment-based therapy and functional communication. The specific questions are: Does ten days of with an intensive comprehensive aphasia/AOS program result in any clinical significant improvements in speech and/or language function and other cognitive skills for participants with chronic aphasia and/or apraxia of speech? Does the intensive intervention have any effect on the quality of everyday life concerning speech and language functions, activity and communicative participation for people with chronic aphasia and apraxia of speech?

The purpose of the MIRAA (Multimodal Intensive Rehabilitation of Aphasia and Apraxia of Speech) project is to study feasibility of intensive intervention for acquired aphasia and apraxia of speech (AOS) after stroke in the regular Swedish health-care according to the updated national guidelines from the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare.","According to the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare's guidelines for stroke care, persons with aphasia shall be offered intensive rehabilitation by speech-language pathologists. The aphasia rehabilitation is however sparse and unevenly distributed over the country as reported by the Swedish Aphasia Foundation. People with aphasia are seldom offered long-term treatment and intensive therapy is rarely offered. Intensive treatment is defined as at least 4h/week by the National Board of Health and Welfare, but higher intensity can be beneficial if tolerated by the patient.

Multimodal Intensive Rehabilitation of Aphasia and Apraxia of speech, MIRAA, is a modified Intensive Comprehensive Aphasia Program (ICAP) intervention program developed in the applicant's research group. MIRAA consists of a selection of evidence-based and/or well-established methods for speech and language rehabilitation as well as computer training. The training is both individual and group based, including communication between participants to promote transfer to real-life situations. Rehabilitation is based on principles that have been shown to promote neuroplasticity changes, such as high training intensity and multiple repetitions of tasks, for learning and relearning after brain injury. The intervention is goal-driven and individualized for high saliency, with focus on each participant's difficulties with language, speech and communication.

Speech and Language Pathologists (SLPs) all over Sweden working with aphasia and/or AOS following stroke are offered to participate in the study. At the time of recruitment, SLPs are invited to respond to a questionnaire about their current practice. SLPs accepting to participate are offered a 2-day workshop and recurring sessions containing introduction to and training in the MIRAA program as well as information about the logistics of the study.

42 SLPs from 23 clinics over the country participate in the study. The SLPs recruit participants with aphasia/AOS from their waiting and offer them a six-week MIRAA rehabilitation program consisting of a combination of individual treatment and group session and computer-assisted/homework training, with the goal level of 60 hours. The content of the program is individually adapted to clinics and participants. Participation in the study is consecutively offered to all individuals with speech language impairment post stroke that meet the inclusion criteria.

Following administration of the MIRAA-program including pre- and post-testing, participating SLPs will complete a questionnaire on their experiences of delivering the intensive intervention and factors hindering and facilitating implementation. Participants with aphasia/AOS and their next of kin will also provide information about their experiences through questionnaires and semi structured interviews, focus groups interviews and participant observations.

All participants are tested pre- post and at follow-up by a speech and language pathologist. Behavioral tests consist of quantitative measurements of speech, language, communication, cognition and quality of life. Part of the testing (TAX and CAT informative speech) is video- recorded for analysis after testing.

Background data are obtained noting sex, age, handedness, education level, language history aphasia type and severity and AOS, time since onset, mental fatigue, social life, number of strokes and earlier intensive rehabilitation at the time of the first assessment.

A subgroup of participants and SLPs from five clinics distributed over varying types of clinics reflecting the diversity among the clinics (inpatient care, primary care) take part in semi-structured interviews based on interview guides combined with focus group interviews and participant observations during one day of the last week of the intensive program focusing on facilitating and hindering factors for complying with an intensive intervention program like MIRAA.

A group consisting of SLPs not being able to participate in the study will form a focus group and discuss the specific factors hindering participation in the study in their respective settings.

The primary aim of this project is to explore the feasibility for national implementation of an intensive comprehensive intervention program for aphasia and AOS following stroke (MIRAA) in Swedish health care.

What are facilitating or hindering factors for SLPs and their patients in the subacute and chronic phase post stroke with aphasia and/or AOS to comply with an intensive intervention program like MIRAA?
How do participants, next of kin and SLPs experience intensive training in terms of effects and satisfaction with the program and with the implementation?

A secondary aim is to examine whether short-term and / or long-term effects on language, speech, communication and quality of life after intensive rehabilitation can be demonstrated.

Can treatment effects regarding speech and/or language be detected when comparing the control group with the intervention group after six weeks of intensive intervention?
Can treatment effects regarding communication and quality of life be detected when comparing the control group with the intervention group after six weeks of intensive intervention?

Approximately one third of people who had a stroke live with a communication disorder, aphasia, which is associated with the largest negative relationship to quality of life. In chronic stages, people with aphasia (PwA) often do not receive any rehabilitation, despite treatment being shown to significantly reduce impairment. In contrast to existing computerized aphasia treatment, VoiceAdapt is an innovative and motivating application for PwA that provides adaptive and context-aware training lessons via speech interaction on the mobile device. A user-centred design process and motivational gamification ensure long-term engagement in training. Through providing an autonomously usable and low-cost tool, VoiceAdapt will positively affect PwA's self-esteem and social inclusion, leading to higher quality of life.","Purpose:

The purpose of the study proposed in this ethics application is to examine the impact of an adaptive speech-language treatment app, created using principles of user-centred design, on language and communication outcomes of people with aphasia (PwA) within a randomized controlled trial.

Background:

Nearly one third of individuals who have a stroke will present with aphasia, a communication impairment that affects the ability to speak, understand, read and write. People with aphasia (PwA) have been shown to demonstrate more limitations in their participation in daily activities, lower quality of life and a higher incidence of depression relative to post-stroke individuals without aphasia, even when other factors such as physical ability, social support and well-being were similar.

The overall goals of the VoiceAdapt research project are to: 1) conduct a needs survey with PwA and speech-language pathologists (SLPs); 2) develop an app employing a user-centred design process; and 3) conduct a randomized controlled trial. Using user-centred design, end users and stakeholders (PwA, therapists and formal/informal caregivers) will be engage din a needs survey during the technology development process. Outcomes will be analyzed to elaborate implications for decision makers as to how to implement such adaptive training environments in stroke rehabilitation. This aspect of the research (i.e., Goals 1 & 2) will be carried out by consortium members in Austria and Germany. Only the randomized controlled trial (Goal 3), which is the subject of the present application, will be conducted at the University of Alberta and the University of Toronto.

PwA will be provided with a personalized speech-language treatment app (i.e., on a tablet), which automatically adapts the exercises to the users' actual skill level. Individual learning progress of PwA will be supported by personalized and gamified training elements to achieve higher compliance and adherence to the exercises. As a primary outcome, the adaptive assistive technology will examine language performance related to the specific intervention of the personalized speech-language treatment app. Additional objectives will examine the change in the overall language and communication functioning of PwA; the well-being and quality of life of PwA and their caregiver's perception of communication effectiveness after intervention with the treatment app.

The research will be carried out by the VoiceAdapt Consortium, which brings together the resources of five participating international institutions. Research partners have expertise in the fields of technology/e-health and graphical design skills (Nurogames, NG), personalization and adaptvitiy (Technical University of Berlin, TUB), user-centred design and gamification/persuasion (Austrian Institute of Technology, AIT), and clinical research and intervention studies (University of Toronto, UoT; University of Alberta, UoA).

Research Methods/Procedures:

Researchers at the University of Alberta and University of Toronto will be the primary investigators of the randomized controlled trial (RCT) portion of the VoiceAdapt Project. The RCT will involve 80 PwA in total across University of Alberta and University of Toronto sites.

Design of the RCT: The RCT will be a two arm, randomized, waitlist-controlled, crossover group design. In Phase 1, PWA randomized to the intervention group will train with VoiceAdapt. The control group will be a waitlist treatment-deferred group. In Phase 2, the control group will train with VoiceAdapt. The randomization of participants will be achieved by computer-generated assignment.

Participants: All participants will have suffered a left hemisphere stroke, be at least 6 months post-onset, and will have aphasia as defined by performance on the Western Aphasia Battery - Rev. (Aphasia Quotient greater than or equal to 30, with a prominent verbal expression impairment), but type of aphasia will not be an inclusion criterion. Participants will speak English as their primary language, pass screenings of visual perception, hearing and basic cognitive functioning and be willing to commit to participation for the study duration.

Intervention: Each intervention phase will last for 5 weeks. During this period, participants in the experimental condition will be asked to do speech language tasks 5 days a week for 60 minutes via the VoiceAdapt app (intervention group). The control group will not be engaged in any one on one speech therapy during the first intervention phase (Phase 1). During the second intervention phase (Phase 2), the control group will participate in training with the VoiceAdapt app (60 minutes/day x 5 days/week) and the intervention group from Phase 1 will crossover into receiving no treatment. Research staff will check in with individuals in the intervention group on a weekly basis to monitor and adjust treatment exercises. Research staff will check in with participants in the control group twice during their respective control phase.

Outcome Measures: In line with the recommended core outcome measures for aphasia research (Wallace et al., 2019), participants in both groups will be tested before and after each condition on the following measures: the primary outcome measure will be the Boston Naming Test (BNT) to measure naming; secondary outcome measures will be: Western Aphasia Battery-Revised (WAB-R); Stroke and Aphasia Quality of Life Scale (SAQOL-39) to measure quality of life; and Communication Effectiveness Index (CETI) to measure the person with aphasia and the partners' perception of the participant's communication. In addition to these measures, the Situational Motivation Scale (SIMS) and an end of study questionnaire will be provided to all participants.

Plan for Data Analysis:

The primary analysis will be a one-sided hypothesis test of the null hypothesis of the change in naming on the Boston Naming Test (BNT) from baseline to week 6, tested at the 0.1 level of significance. The observed change on the BNT as well as the baseline, 6 week and follow up values will be summarized for each group as means and standard deviations. Secondary outcomes will be summarized using means (SD), medians (IQR) or proportions (CI), and analyzed using t tests, as appropriate. All analyses will be presented in aggregate.","aphasia anomia rehabilitation speech-language pathology mobile applications language therapy stroke stroke rehabilitation","Interventional","Inclusion Criteria:

The overall goals of the VoiceAdapt research project are to: 1) conduct a needs survey with PwA and speech-language pathologists (SLPs); 2) develop an app employing a user-centred design process; and 3) conduct a randomized controlled trial. Using user-centred design, end users and stakeholders (PwA, therapists and formal/informal caregivers) will be engage din a needs survey during the technology development process. Outcomes will be analyzed to elaborate implications for decision makers as to how to implement such adaptive training environments in stroke rehabilitation. This aspect of the research (i.e., Goals 1 & 2) will be carried out by consortium members in Austria and Germany. Only the randomized controlled trial (Goal 3), which is the subject of the present application, will be conducted at the University of Alberta and the University of Toronto.

PwA will be provided with a personalized speech-language treatment app (i.e., on a tablet), which automatically adapts the exercises to the users' actual skill level. Individual learning progress of PwA will be supported by personalized and gamified training elements to achieve higher compliance and adherence to the exercises. As a primary outcome, the adaptive assistive technology will examine language performance related to the specific intervention of the personalized speech-language treatment app. Additional objectives will examine the change in the overall language and communication functioning of PwA; the well-being and quality of life of PwA and their caregiver's perception of communication effectiveness after intervention with the treatment app.

The research will be carried out by the VoiceAdapt Consortium, which brings together the resources of five participating international institutions. Research partners have expertise in the fields of technology/e-health and graphical design skills (Nurogames, NG), personalization and adaptvitiy (Technical University of Berlin, TUB), user-centred design and gamification/persuasion (Austrian Institute of Technology, AIT), and clinical research and intervention studies (University of Toronto, UoT; University of Alberta, UoA).

Research Methods/Procedures:

Researchers at the University of Alberta and University of Toronto will be the primary investigators of the randomized controlled trial (RCT) portion of the VoiceAdapt Project. The RCT will involve 80 PwA in total across University of Alberta and University of Toronto sites.

Design of the RCT: The RCT will be a two arm, randomized, waitlist-controlled, crossover group design. In Phase 1, PWA randomized to the intervention group will train with VoiceAdapt. The control group will be a waitlist treatment-deferred group. In Phase 2, the control group will train with VoiceAdapt. The randomization of participants will be achieved by computer-generated assignment.

Participants: All participants will have suffered a left hemisphere stroke, be at least 6 months post-onset, and will have aphasia as defined by performance on the Western Aphasia Battery - Rev. (Aphasia Quotient greater than or equal to 30, with a prominent verbal expression impairment), but type of aphasia will not be an inclusion criterion. Participants will speak English as their primary language, pass screenings of visual perception, hearing and basic cognitive functioning and be willing to commit to participation for the study duration.

Intervention: Each intervention phase will last for 5 weeks. During this period, participants in the experimental condition will be asked to do speech language tasks 5 days a week for 60 minutes via the VoiceAdapt app (intervention group). The control group will not be engaged in any one on one speech therapy during the first intervention phase (Phase 1). During the second intervention phase (Phase 2), the control group will participate in training with the VoiceAdapt app (60 minutes/day x 5 days/week) and the intervention group from Phase 1 will crossover into receiving no treatment. Research staff will check in with individuals in the intervention group on a weekly basis to monitor and adjust treatment exercises. Research staff will check in with participants in the control group twice during their respective control phase.

Outcome Measures: In line with the recommended core outcome measures for aphasia research (Wallace et al., 2019), participants in both groups will be tested before and after each condition on the following measures: the primary outcome measure will be the Boston Naming Test (BNT) to measure naming; secondary outcome measures will be: Western Aphasia Battery-Revised (WAB-R); Stroke and Aphasia Quality of Life Scale (SAQOL-39) to measure quality of life; and Communication Effectiveness Index (CETI) to measure the person with aphasia and the partners' perception of the participant's communication. In addition to these measures, the Situational Motivation Scale (SIMS) and an end of study questionnaire will be provided to all participants.

Plan for Data Analysis:

The primary analysis will be a one-sided hypothesis test of the null hypothesis of the change in naming on the Boston Naming Test (BNT) from baseline to week 6, tested at the 0.1 level of significance. The observed change on the BNT as well as the baseline, 6 week and follow up values will be summarized for each group as means and standard deviations. Secondary outcomes will be summarized using means (SD), medians (IQR) or proportions (CI), and analyzed using t tests, as appropriate. All analyses will be presented in aggregate.","aphasia anomia rehabilitation speech-language pathology mobile applications language therapy stroke stroke rehabilitation","Interventional","Inclusion Criteria:

It will do so by incorporating communication supports and compensatory speech-language treatment. The goal of developing this integrated treatment is to improve successful communication participation, psychosocial adjustment, and quality of life for stroke survivors with aphasia.

In the first phase of the project, the investigators will create a treatment manual with input from a stakeholder advisory board consisting of caregivers and stroke survivors with aphasia. The investigators will then recruit an initial cohort of five stroke survivors with aphasia to undergo the initial version of the treatment based and provide feedback. This will aid revision of the manual, which the investigators will then evaluate using a second cohort of 16 stroke survivors with aphasia. The investigators predict that ACT for Aphasia will be acceptable and feasible based on measures of participant satisfaction and treatment adherence. The investigators will also measure pre- to post-treatment changes in psychological distress, functional disability, quality of life, and communication participation and functioning to establish preliminary effect size estimates for this intervention, in preparation for a subsequent Stage II efficacy trial.","The overarching goals of this research are to improve psychosocial adjustment, quality of life, and successful communication participation by developing Act for Aphasia, a patient-centered, manualized behavioral intervention in Stage I research. Stroke survivors with aphasia in their first year post stroke will complete a 10-session intervention. In study Aim 1, the investigators will engage a Stakeholder Advisory Board (SAB) of people with aphasia (PWA) and caregivers to provide input to develop a treatment manual. The investigators will then use an iterative design process and two successive participant cohorts to refine the manual. Cohort 1 (N=5) will participate in the initial version of the treatment, then help inform its revision by being invited to join the SAB. Cohort 2 (N=16) will participate in the revised version. In Aim 2a the investigators will establish feasibility and acceptability of this intervention. In Aim 2b the investigators will estimate preliminary effect sizes for a subsequent Stage II efficacy trial.

Participant assignment: given the early phase of this research and the lack of control conditions or groups, there will be no random assignment. Participants will be enrolled in the study as they are referred and found to be eligible, with the first five participants being enrolled in the first study cohort during year 1 while the remainder of participants will be enrolled in the second cohort across years 1 and 2.

Intervention description: the ACT for Aphasia treatment manual will be a 10-session intervention created by modifying an existing ACT manual provided by Dr. Meyer. To meet the specific needs of stroke survivors with aphasia, ACT will be modified in two main ways. First, the intervention will include modified language and communication supports to address the unique communication challenges faced by people with aphasia that could impede engagement with ACT content. Multi-modality communication supports will be provided by the treating clinician (e.g., writing out key words to support verbal content, summarizing and providing repetitions, providing session summaries to review between sessions). Manual creation will follow existing practice recommendations for modifying counseling interventions for PWA (e.g., simplifying language and increasing use of visual metaphors) which will be reviewed by the SAB. Second, ACT will be further augmented via individualized language compensation training and a focus on identifying and addressing communication-based barriers to life participation. Language training will focus on active compensatory strategies such as self-cuing, use of alternative modalities (gesture, writing), and use of commonly available technology (e.g., smartphone dictionaries, text-to-speech). The details of this language compensation training will also be determined based on input from the SAB, and will be revised after reviewing performance and interview feedback from each successive cohort.

Intervention administration procedures: all aspects of the treatment protocol will be administered by Dr. Evans or a licensed speech-language pathologist on study staff who has received training in providing ACT. The intervention will consist of 10 weekly treatment sessions. Post-treatment interviews providing feedback for protocol revision will be administered by Dr. Evans within 2 weeks of study completion. Interviews will use a semi-structured, ethnographic interview approach and be video-recorded. These interviews will ask specific questions about the participant's experience and perspective regarding each functional domain of the intervention (i.e., the ""Open Up,"" ""Be Present,"" and ""Do What Matters"" components of ACT and the individualized language compensation training), and will be asked for suggestions and improvements about the specific content and techniques employed.","Counseling Therapeutics","Interventional","Inclusion Criteria:

One common type of aphasia is known as non-fluent aphasia. Patients with non-fluent aphasia have difficulty formulating grammatical sentences, often producing short word fragments despite having a good understanding of what others are trying to communicate to them. Speech language pathologists (SLPs) play a central role rehabilitating persons with aphasia and administer therapy in an attempt to improve communication skills. Despite standard therapy, approximately 50% of individuals who experience aphasia acutely continue to have language deficits more than 6 months post-stroke.

In most people, Broca's area is dominant in the left side of the brain. Following a left-sided stroke, the right-sided homologue of Broca's area (the pars triangularis), may adopt language function. Unfortunately, reorganizing language to the right side of the brain seems to be less effective than restoring function to the left hemisphere. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), a form of non-invasive brain stimulation, can be used to suppress activity of specific regions in the right side of the brain to promote recovery of function in the perilesional area. Despite preliminary success in existing studies using rTMS in post-stroke aphasia, there is much work to be done to better understand the mechanisms underlying recovery.

There are a few important reasons underlying this discrepancy. For example, considerable emphasis is placed on acute and subacute stroke recovery with less therapy focus on the chronic period, when recovery is usually slower.

This study will build on a growing evidence base for the efficacy of therapeutic language games in post stroke aphasia. In today's resource-constrained National Health Service, SLTs are continually searching for cost-effective, innovative ways of delivering therapy. Language games based on sound neuro-scientific principles have the potential to deliver improvements in functional communication by means of an enjoyable and motivating activity, and moreover can be done cost effectively. Improvements have been demonstrated from the acute through to the chronic stage of stroke. A number of factors are said to contribute to the outcomes achieved: intensity of training, behavioural relevance and focussed use of capacities. This study intends to explore in more depth some of the specific behaviours that can occur spontaneously or than can be prompted to facilitate language. The aim is to uncover the ""active ingredient"", and thereby ensure that participants can benefit maximally from therapeutic language games.

While recovery can be promoted with speech therapy, improvement remains modest and typically requires a large number of sessions contributing to rising health care costs. Traditional aphasia therapy focus on enhancing speech motor output; however, recent evidence suggests that the auditory feedback also plays a critical role in fluent speech. Therefore, a key step toward refining treatment strategies is to develop objective biomarkers that can probe the integrity of sensorimotor mechanisms of speech auditory feedback and identify their impaired function in patients with post-stroke aphasia. This study aims to examine the behavioral, neurophysiological (EEG), and neuroimaging (fMRI) biomarkers of speech impairment following stroke with focus on understanding the role of auditory feedback for speech production and control. We plan to test individuals with post-stroke aphasia and a matched neuroptypical control group during different speech production tasks under the altered auditory feedback paradigm. In addition, we aim to examine the effect of audio-visual feedback training on enhancing communication ability during speech. These biomarkers will be combined with existing lesion-symptom-mapping data in the aphasic group in order to identify the patterns of brain damage and diminished structural connectivity within the auditory-motor areas of the left hemisphere that predict impaired sensorimotor processing of speech in aphasia.

Although the treatment appears promising, data to date do not permit an adequate assessment of the utility of the technique. The investigators propose to study the effects of TMS combined with Constraint Induced Language Therapy (CILT) in 75 subjects with chronic aphasia. Subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to TMS with CILT or sham TMS with CILT. One Hz TMS at 90% motor threshold will be delivered to the right inferior frontal gyrus for 20 minutes in 10 sessions over 2 weeks; language therapy will be provided for one hour immediately after the conclusion of each session of TMS. Change from baseline in the Western Aphasia Battery Aphasia Quotient at 6 months after the end of TMS treatment will serve as the primary outcome measure. A secondary aim is to identify anatomic and behavioral predictors of response to treatment. Finally, a third aim is to identify the mechanism underlying the beneficial effect of the treatment using a variety of imaging techniques. Subjects who have no contraindication to the MRI will undergo fMRI imaging prior to and at 6 months after therapy. Using modern network analyses and robust machine learning techniques, the investigators will identify changes in the strengths of connections between nodes in the language network to address specific hypotheses regarding the effects of TMS and CILT on brain organization that are associated with beneficial response to treatment.","TMS is a technique by which a brief electrical current is induced in brain tissue causing a brief suppression of the excitability of the underlying tissue; the technique, which was introduced in the 1980s and has been extensively used around the world, has been shown to transiently improve or disrupt specific cognitive operations. To achieve this end, a coil is positioned against the subject's head. The delivery of a single pulse begins with the discharge of current from a capacitor into a circular or figure-of-eight coil; this electrical current generates a brief magnetic field of up to 2.2 Tesla. As the pulse of electricity has a rise time of 0.2 ms. and a duration of 1 ms., the magnetic field changes in intensity quite rapidly. Because the magnetic field passes freely through the scalp, skull, and meninges, the flux in the magnetic field induces a small electric field in the brain that transiently alters neural activity.

TMS may be delivered in a variety of ways. The investigators propose to use 1 Hz TMS; that is, TMS pulses will be delivered at a frequency of 1/second. This style of TMS is assumed to be inhibitory in that it transiently suppresses the function of the cortex under the coil. Using the figure-of-eight coil to be employed here, TMS is thought to reduce activity in approximately 1 cubic cm. of cortex. Many investigators have employed TMS with a frequency of 1 Hz for periods of 20 minutes and longer; mild behavioral deficits are often present for several minutes in these studies.

The baseline phase will consist of 3 sessions, each lasting 1-2 hours depending on the stamina of the subject. The point of the baseline testing is to characterize the subject's language function. To that end, a number of standard language and neuropsychological tasks will be administered. These include the Western Aphasia Battery, Pyramids and Palm Trees test, Figural Fluency Test, word and non-word repetition tasks, the Nicholas and Brookshire Narratives, CILT stimulus naming, and Northwestern Assessment of Verbs and Sentences. Additionally, during the baseline, subjects will undergo MRI of the brain or, if they have a contraindication to MRI, a CAT scan of the head. No contrast will be used.

In the treatment phase, there will be 10 TMS sessions over 2 consecutive weeks in which 20 minutes (1200 pulses) of 1 Hz TMS at 90% motor threshold will be delivered to the inferior pars triangularis. Each TMS treatment session will be immediately followed by a 60-90 minute session of CILT

There will be two 3-month post-treatment visits and two 6-month post-treatment visits in which the full battery of language and cognitive assessments will be repeated. Subjects who are able to undergo MRI scanning will have anatomic and fMRI scans at the first 6-month post-treatment visit.

The investigators will pair TMS with CILT which has been shown to have positive outcomes in post-stroke aphasia. CILT invokes use-dependent learning in communicative interactions by requiring spoken output and restricting use of alternative forms of communication, such as gestures. The investigators will use a dual card-matching task modeled after Maher et al. As in the original CILT design, the participant interacts verbally with a conversational partner (here, the speech language pathologist), in turn requesting a card of given description and complying with the partner's request. In this way, the treatment targets both production and comprehension. Moreover, as verbal targets increase in linguistic complexity across the protocol (""a ball"", ""throw a ball""; ""Do you have a ball""?), a variety of lexical and phrasal structures are targeted. Studies of CILT have reported gains on multiple language behaviors, supporting its broad engagement of the language network.","","Interventional","Inclusion Criteria:

The medical community cannot predict how well someone with aphasia will respond to treatment, as some people with aphasia are poor responders to intervention even when participating in empirically supported treatments. There is a strong likelihood that genetics play a role in language recovery after stroke, but very little research has been dedicated to investigating this link. This study will investigate whether two genes and cognitive abilities, such as memory, predict responsiveness to aphasia therapy for word-retrieval difficulties.","Incomplete understanding of patient-specific factors that determine whether someone will respond well to language therapy after stroke limits the development of methods to target or account for sources of variability. There is a strong likelihood that genetics play a role in language recovery after stroke, but very little research has been dedicated to investigating this link. The long-term goal of this line of work is to maximize response to aphasia therapy by incorporating patient-specific factors into decisions related to treatment planning. The overall objective of this application is to identify patterns of patient-specific factors including two candidate genes and cognitive skills that show a relationship with treatment outcomes. The central hypothesis is that there will be a relationship between ApoE and BDNF genotypes, and working memory on stimulus generalization. The rationale for the proposed project is that the identification of factors that impact treatment responsiveness will allow for better estimation of prognosis, improved triage of individuals into appropriate therapy regimens and direct targeting of cognitive factors to maximize behavioral gains. The two specific aims of the project are to determine the degree to which (1) ApoE and BDNF genotypes influence how individuals with aphasia respond to therapy, and (2) working memory abilities are related to stimulus acquisition and stimulus generalization after anomia therapy. Individuals with chronic post-stroke aphasia will undergo cognitive and language assessment, and provide a saliva sample for genetic analysis prior to participating in a cued picture-naming therapy for anomia. The expected outcomes are to integrate cognitive scores and genotypes for BDNF and ApoE into formulating probabilities of individual patient responsiveness to restorative therapy. Improvement in word retrieval abilities will be evaluated using the percentage of pictures named correctly. This contribution is expected to be significant because it will allow for more informed clinical decision making and better allocation of resources to appropriate treatments, thereby making advances in the field toward more personalized medicine, as opposed to a one-size-fits-all clinical approach.

The investigators will determine genotypes for BDNF and ApoE, which will yield four separate groups. At least 20 participants will be enrolled for each genotype group.","","Interventional","Inclusion Criteria:

Using a computer based speech and language therapy program, participants will practice conversational scripts that are either short or long. Participants will practice for either 2 weeks (5 days a week) or for 5 weeks (2 days a week).","Determining the optimal intensity of treatment is essential to the design and implementation of any treatment program for aphasia. Yet, treatment intensity is a complex construct and information on the variables modulating it remain ambiguous and limited. Studies reported in the neuroscience and clinical literature support the need for intensive treatment to induce long-term neuroplastic changes while the cognitive psychology literature suggests that learning is best maintained with distributed schedules. A few studies have looked at dose parameters for single word naming tasks, but there is limited evidence regarding dose parameters for treatments that focus on training the production of larger units, such as sentences or even connected discourse. One approach that is frequently used clinically and has evidence for its efficacy is script training. Little is currently known regarding the optimum dose of script training (i.e., the number of repetitions over time of each sentence within the script) that is required to promote the best outcomes.

This study investigates the effects of modulating stimulus variables, specifically stimulus practice distribution and stimulus repetition. We use a baseline script treatment that has experimental support regarding its efficacy, and that allows the manipulation of these variables. To ensure independence and fidelity, treatment is provided in a controlled computer environment (desktop and tablet). To avoid clinician-related variables such as expertise and personality factors that may influence treatment, sentences are modeled during treatment by an anthropomorphic agent with high visual speech intelligibility and affective expressions.

With regard to ""best outcomes"", generalization is the ultimate goal of any treatment approach. Therefore, the primary outcome is a generalization measure of conversation. Secondary measures address short-term acquisition, longer-term maintenance, and stimulus and response generalization for assessing gain over baseline, differential effects, and interactions. A mobile-connected wireless wearable laryngeal sensor allows tracking of talk time at home and in the community as a measure of treatment effectiveness and transfer. For privacy, it does not record audio.

Results and computational models of learning (generalization, short-term acquisition, and longer-term maintenance) will contribute new evidence to fill critical gaps in current scientific understanding regarding the effectiveness and clinical application of aphasia treatment approaches. More generally, findings will help to inform clinical practice and treatment of neurologic communication disorders; the virtual clinician guided intervention that the proposal develops has the potential to reduce costly clinician-client time otherwise required for long-term rehabilitation.","Stroke Speech and Language Therapy Speech and Language Treatment Communication Disorders Language Disorders","Interventional","Inclusion Criteria:

Aphasia impacts language production and comprehension as well as reading and writing. The ramifications of aphasia extend beyond language impairment to negatively impacting a person's social, vocational, and recreational activities. Currently, the most effective way to treat aphasia is with speech-language therapy (SLT). However, even if SLT is intensive, persons with aphasia are left with residual language delays. Recent research suggests that pairing SLT with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) a non-invasive, safe, low-cost form of brain stimulation may aid language recovery in persons with aphasia. However, results from tDCS studies are inconclusive. The success of tDCS in combination with SLT could depend on the timing of tDCS since tDCS-induced effects depend on the neuronal state of the brain-networks at the time of the stimulation. In this study, the differential impact of tDCS before behavioral SLT (offline-before therapy), tDCS after SLT (offline-after therapy), and tDCS concurrently with SLT (online) on functional language recovery in persons with aphasia will be investigated. Sham tDCS (i.e., SLT alone) as a control group will also be included in the study. The investigators hypothesize that both offline and online tDCS will improve language functioning than sham tDCS.","tDCS Implementation:

2mA of direct current for 20 minutes will be delivered using a constant current stimulator via two electrodes in saline soaked sponges. To stimulate the left angular gyrus, a cathodal electrode inside a saline soaked sponge (5 x 3cm) will be placed over the CP5 according to the 10-20 international system for EEG electrode placement. The electrodes will be secured in position by a custom-built EEG cap that will be marked with the location for angular gyrus. The investigators will then confirm that the cathodal electrode is over the left angular through the use of neuronavigation. The ""return"" anode electrode will be placed in a saline soaked sponge (5 x 5cm) on the center of the supraorbital region.

At the beginning of the tDCS, current will slowly ram-up during the first few seconds until it reaches 2mA. The ramp-up process will acclimate the participants to tDCS-induced sensations (e.g., itching). At the end of the tDCS sessions, current will slowly ramp down in the last few seconds to 0mA. The total duration of the 2mA current will be maintained for 20 minutes. For sham stimulation, the investigators will place the electrodes in the same location as the real tDCS groups with stimulation ending after few seconds. The brief stimulation will produce tDCS-induced sensations so that participants will not be aware when the tDCS stopped delivering direct current

Speech-Language Treatment:

Standard-of-care treatment - script training will be used to provide SLT to our participants. The treatment will be delivered via a computer program, Aphasia Scripts ®, whereby a virtual therapist interactively guides the participants through treatment steps. Scripts will be five to ten sentences and developed from common templates about topics relevant to daily life (e.g., asking questions at the grocery store, ordering in a restaurant). The advantage of using a computer program instead of a human therapist is that it removes extraneous variables associated with human therapists (e.g., different levels of encouragement) and this, together with the use of script templates, ensures treatment fidelity across participants.

Duration of an individual subject's participation in the study:

Subjects will be requested to come for baseline sessions (3 to 4 hours) before the actual experiment. The baseline assessments may be done over two visits. In the baseline session the subjects' aphasia severity will be assessed. The participants will also perform baseline tasks of language and cognition in this session. Subjects will then participate in 3 weeks of tDCS and SLT (i.e., 15 sessions). The sessions will consist of 40 minutes of SLT and 20 minutes of tDCS. Subjects will be asked to return for an assessment immediately following the end of treatment and for follow-up testing after 4 and 8 weeks. Therefore, total number of visits will be 19-23 sessions (depending on how many visits are needed for the assessments) over a period of three months.","Aphasia, tDCS, Script training, Functional language, Naming","Interventional","Inclusion Criteria:

It is not well understood why and how this technique works. One goal of this study is to determine who benefits from speaking in unison, and what characteristics of speech are most helpful. Another goal is to investigate a possible mechanism for this benefit: why does speaking in unison help? A possible mechanism for this benefit is examined, by testing whether the degree of alignment of a person's speech with that of another speaker can account for unison benefit.","Aphasia is an acquired language disorder, most commonly due to stroke. It can affect an individual's ability to speak, understand spoken language, read, and write. Many treatments designed to improve spoken language in persons with aphasia (PWAs) use unison speech, having the person with aphasia speak along with the clinician or with a recording. One goal of this study is to determine who benefits from speaking in unison, and what characteristics of speech help them the most. Another goal is to investigate a possible mechanism for this benefit: why does speaking in unison help? This knowledge is important because understanding who benefits from this commonly used and potentially powerful therapy component, under which conditions they benefit, and why they do, is critical for customizing therapy so it can be as effective and efficient as possible. Unison speech is conducted using one of two different timing patterns: (1) a natural conversational pattern, which is used in everyday conversations, or (2) a metrical pattern, which follows a beat-based timing framework, as in songs or some poems. In either case, precisely aligning one's speech with that of another person (i.e., entraining one's speech) requires prediction: each speaker must plan their own speech motor commands before having heard the other speaker say the words they are planning. Natural conversational timing requires the speaker to make use of knowledge about language, particularly grammar, to align with the other person. In contrast, a metrical pattern allows a speaker to predict speech timing without relying heavily on language-based knowledge. Given that many PWAs have impaired grammar, we hypothesize that most PWAs will benefit more from speaking in unison to sentences with metrical vs. conversational timing patterns. However, there is great variation in linguistic, motor speech, and timing skills across PWAs, so metrical and conversational timing patterns are likely to have different degrees of effectiveness for different individuals. Results from this study will demonstrate how individual characteristics and speech timing affect whether or not a person with aphasia benefits from speaking in unison. Results will also indicate whether a speaker's ability to predict speech timing is necessary for a benefit of unison speech. Prediction ability will be measured by how closely the speaker aligns their speech with a spoken model.","","Interventional","Inclusion Criteria:

Because all PWA have word retrieval deficits, this project will test if greater language gains can be achieved by supplementing anomia intervention with excitatory brain stimulation to the left hemisphere and will evaluate associated functional brain changes to aid the optimization of neural reorganization to facilitate language processing.","Aphasia is a language impairment that commonly occurs following brain damage (e.g., stroke). While language rehabilitation can yield improved language functioning, treatment outcomes vary greatly across individuals. In chronic aphasia, language gains occur through the brain's inherent ability to reorganize (i.e., neuroplasticity).

While Speech-language therapy (SLT) can target various language skills and modalities, the most pervasive deficit across all persons with aphasia (PWA) is difficulty with word finding. Thus, aphasia treatment often includes some form of intervention focused on improving naming abilities. As with language function in general, naming abilities in PWA seems to be associated with left hemisphere recruitment, particularly with the viable tissue at the rim of the lesion (perilesional areas). This project investigates an innovative approach to improving current therapy by examining the benefits of using excitatory transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) stimulation/neuromodulation during anomia treatment (i.e. word-finding treatment).

This study investigates an innovative approach to improving current therapy by examining the benefits of using excitatory tDCS stimulation/neuromodulation during anomia treatment. This project will provide novel mechanistic understanding of changes in functional brain connectivity in persons with post-stroke aphasia and how connectivity relates to treatment outcomes.

The aims of this study are as follows:

Aim 1. To investigate the benefits of using broad transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to improve word retrieval in persons with aphasia (PWA). Aim 2. To study functional brain changes related to this treatment. Aim 3. To examine behavioral and neural re-organization correlates related to treatment outcomes.

All participants will complete the following 3 components: (1) Baseline Assessment, (2) Interventions (i.e., SLT with active tDCS & sham tDCS , and (3) Outcome Testing (i.e., Behavioral & Brain Imaging).

Approximately 180,000 new cases of aphasia are identified per year, and approximately 1 million or 1 in 250 are living with aphasia in the United States (NIH-NIDCD, 2015). Treatments are limited and provide modest benefits at best. The current emphasis in aphasia rehabilitation is to formulate intensive speech and language therapies and augment therapeutic benefits by providing brain stimulation concurrent with therapies. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is one of the most widely used such technique. While tDCS has had relative success in chronic aphasia (>6 months after stroke), it has not been efficacious during subacute stages (<3 months after stroke). But enhancing language recovery early after stroke is desirable because of its potential impact on long-term language outcomes and quality-of-life.

The current study will investigate the efficacy of high-definition tACS (HD-tACS) to help restore neural oscillatory activity in aphasia. TACS differs from tDCS in that sinusoidal, alternating currents are delivered rather than constant currents. TACS can manipulate the ongoing oscillatory neuronal activity and potentially increase functional synchronization (or connectivity) between targeted areas. This feature of tACS is quite attractive, given the new body of evidence suggesting that language impairments stem from diminished functional connectivity and disruptions in the language network due to stroke. The selection of tACS frequencies in this study is guided by our preliminary work examining pathological neural oscillations found near stroke-lesioned areas (or perilesional) in aphasia. By exogenously tuning the perilesional oscillations with tACS, the investigators hope to up-regulate communication across these areas and other connected areas to improve language outcome. If successful, tACS will be a powerful and novel treatment approach with reverberating positive impact on long-term recovery.

The study will employ HD-tACS in a within-subject and sham-controlled design, using two frequencies (alpha/10 Hz and low-gamma/40 Hz) combined with language tasks and electroencephalography (EEG) to evaluate subsequent behavioral and neurophysiological changes. Investigators plan to recruit 50 participants: 25 stroke survivors with aphasia at lease 1 month after stroke, and 25 healthy controls.

Participants will complete language testing that covers a broad range of language functions, medical history, and MRI. Eligible participants will undergo active tACS at 10 Hz or 40 Hz, or sham-tACS. All participants will receive all three stimulation types during separate visits. The tACS administrator and participants will be blinded to the stimulation type. The order of stimulation type will be counterbalanced across participants. Washout period between visits will be at least 48 hours to minimize potential carryover effects. EEG will be acquired before and after tACS during periods of rest (resting-state) and during language tasks. Participants will complete a questionnaire at the end of stimulation visits to assess potential side effects of tACS. Total time enrolled in the study is expected to be 2-3 weeks, which may be longer depending on participant's availability.","language language impairment transcranial alternating current stimulation tACS","Interventional","Inclusion Criteria:

Furthermore, in Sweden, as well as in several other countries, access to speech-language therapy is limited. The purpose of this clinical trial is to compare outcome from Verb Network Strengthening Treatment (VNeST) provided as In-Clinic therapy (I-CT) or as synchronous telepractice therapy (TP-T).","Every year thousands of persons in Sweden suffer from brain damage resulting in anomia, that is, word finding difficulties affecting their ability to talk to other people. Anomia is one of the most common and persistent symptoms of aphasia following a left hemisphere stroke, but it is also common in in progressive neurological diseases such as Parkinson's disease or multiple sclerosis (MS). There is evidence that more intensive speech language therapy may improve speech even in a chronic (> six month post stroke) phase of aphasia. However, access to the necessary amount of speech language therapy is limited due to lack of financial resources as well as to limitations to service providers in more rural areas.

It has been suggested that telepractice may increase the access to speech-language therapy for more people but there is a lack of knowledge of whether there is a difference in outcome from interventions provided as In-Clinic therapy (I-CT) or as telepractice therapy (TP-T).

Verb Network Strengthening Treatment (VNeST) is an anomia therapy focused on the production of short phrases. The participants generate thematically related verbs and nouns to strengthen the neural connections between the action (verb) and related thematic roles (agents and patients). From orally and written stimuli, the participants are asked to tell whom (subject) may do something (verb) with what (object) and then to do short expansions from this basic phrase. So far, results from single-case experimental design studies performed by Edmonds and colleagues are promising, showing generalization of outcomes to untrained items. Moreover, improvement in word finding was observed in other tasks like object and verb naming as well as sentence production and partly to connected speech.

The present project explores the effectiveness of VNeST, first in a small pilot study, then in a clinical trial including 80 participants. Participants with left hemisphere aphasia will be randomized to either an in-clinic therapy (I-CT) group or a telepractice therapy (TP-T) group and provided VNeST following the same treatment protocol based on Edmonds (2014).

The instigators' method is based on the reinforcement of the interaction between perceptual and motor representations, thanks to the innovative Ultraspeech device. The investigators will exploit a fundamental psycholinguistic principle, which postulates that speech is based both on the activation of the system controlling the motricity of effectors related to word articulation (action) and on the auditory or visual representation of words (perception). The sensory-motor interaction method that the investigators propose allows the patient to perceive phonemes and visualize on a computer screen the movements of the tongue and lips previously recorded by a healthy speaker, typically a speech therapist. Through repeated exercises, the patient is trained to produce sounds correctly, using the correct pronunciation and articulatory movements of the reference speaker as a model. The investigators will compare patients who will follow a classical speech and language therapy rehabilitation program followed by an 'enriched' rehabilitation program including rehabilitation based on sensory-motor interaction associated with speech and language therapy, and vice versa. In order to judge the favorable effect of the rehabilitation program including sensory-motor integration, the following measures will be considered: (a) language skills, (b) phonemic quality, (c) inner speech abilities and (d) cognitive function.

Aphasia treatments include speech and language therapy and pharmacologic therapy, but several studies have found that these treatments are not completely effective for patients with aphasia, leaving them with residual deficits that significantly add to the cost of stroke-related care. Additionally, the amount and frequency of speech and language therapy delivered may have a critical effect on recovery. Therefore, there is a need for new treatments or adjuncts to existing treatments, such as brain stimulation interventions, that have the potential to show greater improvements in patients with aphasia. One such new approach for non-invasive brain stimulation is transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS).

As the population of Veterans continues to age, there will be an increasing number for Veterans living with the aphasia and its consequences. Those Veterans deserve to receive aphasia treatment designed to facilitate the best possible outcomes. In the proposed study, the investigators will investigate optimal treatment intensity and predictors of treatment response for a novel word retrieval treatment. The knowledge the investigators gain will have direct implications for the selecting the right treatment approach for the right Veteran.","Difficulty retrieving words is one of the most common language complaints in individuals with stroke-induced aphasia. The negative consequences related to word retrieval impairment include increased health care costs and decreased quality of life. A variety of treatment approaches exist to improve word retrieval, and most of the treatments result in immediate improvement on trained words.

Spatial-motor-sensory problems limit functioning and independence, which is costly to Veterans, their families, and society. Currently, spatial-motor-sensory problems are targeted using different treatments. However, there is a treatment that has shown promise in simultaneously targeting spatial function, motor function and pain in right-brain stroke. The investigators propose to investigate the feasibility of using adapted spatial-motor sensory assessment and treatment procedures for Veterans with left-brain stroke who have language and cognitive impairment. The next step will be to conduct a large-scale study focused on this multi-target treatment for more efficient and effective stroke rehabilitation. The investigators expect this line of research to increase functioning, independence and quality of life in Veteran stroke survivors.","The functional disability experienced by Veterans after stroke, and the limited rehabilitation resources available, highlight the importance of identifying feasible treatments acting on more than one recovery target. Currently, there are separate and modality-specific treatment pathways for cognitive and motor impairments. These modality-specific treatment pathways lead to fragmentation of care, and under-identification and under-treatment of invisible disabilities, such as spatial neglect, aphasia and pain. The result is longer hospital stays, greater risk of falls, and poor functional outcomes. Employing a treatment that simultaneously addresses multiple targets will ensure that the investigators provide the needed care for >50% of post-stroke Veterans who have both visible and invisible disabilities, during the critical post-acute period of recovery.

Prism adaptation treatment (PAT) is a 10-day regimen reported to be inexpensive, replicable and effective for treatment of spatial neglect, and studies have demonstrated that it also enhances everyday activities and motor recovery and reduces chronic post-stroke pain in patients with right brain stroke. Additionally, brain mapping methods have shown that in patients with right brain stroke, those with frontal lesions respond optimally to PAT. No studies have investigated PAT in left-brain stroke patients with language and cognitive impairment. To address this research gap, the investigators will address the following aims:

Aim 1: To demonstrate the feasibility of adapted PAT procedures in patients with aphasia and memory impairment. .

Aim 2: To demonstrate the feasibility of adapted methods for assessing spatial and motor function and pain in patients with aphasia and memory impairment.

The investigators are also studying how inflammation is related to the symptoms that first occur in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). For this reason, the investigators are asking people with different versions of Alzheimer's disease to participate. This includes patients with either:

Posterior cortical atrophy - a version of Alzheimer's disease with vision difficulties
Logopenic variant primary progressive aphasia - a version of Alzheimer's disease with language difficulties
Amnestic Alzheimer's disease - a ""typical"" version of Alzheimer's disease with memory difficulties
The investigators are also enrolling older adults with normal visual, language, and memory function.","This study is being done to learn about inflammation in Alzheimer's disease so that the investigators can find out new ways to treat patients with this disease. Because Alzheimer's disease usually causes slow changes to the brain over time, in this study the investigators are going to perform different tests and then repeat some of them two years later.

Inflammation can be measured using a type of brain scan called a positron emission tomography (PET) scan. A PET scan uses very small amounts of a radioactive drug that is injected into a vein to create a special picture of the brain. The inflammation PET scan uses a drug called ER176. ER176 is an experimental drug but has been used in several human studies before. Once in the body, ER176 sticks to areas with lots of inflammation, and the PET scan allows us to see these areas.

Inflammation can also be measured by looking at certain proteins in the spinal fluid. In order to measure these proteins in the spinal fluid, the investigators need to perform a lumbar puncture (spinal tap). Certain genes that inherited from parents influence the amount of inflammation in the body. The investigators can study how genes affect inflammation in Alzheimer's disease by looking doing genetic tests on blood that collected from the vein.

The investigators can study how genes affect inflammation in Alzheimer's disease by doing genetic tests on blood. The investigators will also be testing blood for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)- CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) antibodies. The investigators want to see if exposure to the virus that causes COVID-19 changes the amount of inflammation in the brain or not.

Along with inflammation, Alzheimer's disease is also associated with the build up of the proteins amyloid and tau in the brain. The investigators can measure these proteins using PET scans. The amyloid PET scan uses a drug called florbetaben that has been approved by the FDA to help diagnose Alzheimer's disease. The tau PET scan uses a drug called MK-6240. Like ER176, MK-6240 is experimental but has been used in several human studies before.

A brain MRI creates a high resolution picture of the brain. The brain MRI helps the investigators get more information from the PET scans, and can also tell the investigators the size and appearance of different brain structures. When someone has Alzheimer's disease, some of these brain structures get smaller or have altered appearance on MRI.","Inflammation PET scans Cognitive Impairment Posterior Cortical Atrophy Logopenic Variant Primary Progressive Aphasia Amnestic Alzheimer's Disease MK-6240","Interventional","Inclusion Criteria:

"77",96,"Digital Interventions in Neurorehabilitation: iTALKbetter","Stroke Aphasia Anomia","October 14, 2019","NCT04566081","University College, London London NA United Kingdom","University College, London","Recruiting","iTALKBetter will provide an app-based therapy for people with word retrieval difficulties who have had a stroke.

This study aims to test the therapy application for people with naming difficulties through a small scale randomized controlled trial.","Mortality from stroke in the UK has reduced from 21% in 1999 to 12% in 2008. However, stroke prevalence has been increasing, the consequence of socioeconomic and scientific advances that have improved survival; which means that more people are surviving with long-standing disability. Language impairment (aphasia) is the second most common major impairment after stroke, with a prevalence of 250,000 in the UK. Aphasia may respond to therapy many months and years after the stroke occurs, but provision of specialist therapy (speech and language therapy - SALT) is far below that needed to provide optimal rehabilitation.

The investigators will address this by targeting a common symptom of post-stroke aphasia: impaired word retrieval problems. This is particularly important in patients receiving rehabilitation for associated disabilities as poor speech production can impair participation/compliance with treatment programmes. Our study is designed to improve word retrieval in patients with post-stroke aphasia, who are in the chronic phase (>6 months post-stroke).

The main aim is to test the clinical efficacy of a novel, web-based, DNI. iTALKbetter will provide an effective training tool that patients can use to practice independently. This will free-up SALT time to provide additional assessment, supervision and functional intervention in a highly cost effective manner.

iTALKbetter will provide an app-based therapy for people with word retrieval difficulties who have had a stroke (naming app for a wide variety of common words and phrases).

This Digital Neuro Intervention (DNI) will provide the opportunity for the necessary increased rehabilitation to help people recover lost naming function. This will alleviate NHS Speech and Language Therapist (SALT) time and put users in control of when and where they carry out practice-based language therapy.

Purpose iTALKbetter will provide an app-based therapy for people with word retrieval difficulties who have had a stroke (naming app for a wide variety of common words and phrases).

What does it do? The DNI works via mass practice and feedback to the users on a trial-by-trial basis. The DNI is very simple in a way; it just presents a long series of pictures for users to name. The DNI will use speech recognition (SR) software in order to make a binary decision as to whether the user said the correct word or not. This affects what the next trial (object to name) is and what auditory cue (if any) is provided the next time the user has to name the same item.

What is the clinical trial design? A small, well-defined sample of patients with the potential to benefit from the DNI will be recruited. The main outcome measure is whether the DNI is effective at improving naming impairments. This comparison is within-subject and is achieved by comparing post-therapy measures to multiple baseline measures. A comparison of two different versions of the therapy (a between group comparison) is also planned to answer our secondary question of whether the therapy can be optimised. Outcome measures will be collected by the research team using a variety of standardized and non-standardized tests of language and cognition. These outcome measures are not built into the DNI at this point.

The DNI will be introduced to the participant when attending a testing session. One of the research team will explain how to use the DNI, provide instructions for the user, and give some time for practice items. When confident that the participant can use the DNI independently, the participant will take the device home and continue their therapy (suggested therapy time is 5-10 hours per week) which will be simultaneously monitored by the research team. The research team will also check in on the participant weekly to trouble shoot any difficulties they may have (whether motivational or technical). When the participant has completed the therapy block, they will be invited in again for testing and they will return the mobile device with the DNI on it. The participants who continue to receive standard care during the therapy block will be asked to record and submit details to the research team

Why is the research considered worth doing? Standard (face to face) Speech and Language Therapy (SALT) has a huge evidence-base but patients in the NHS have unmet therapy needs due to a lack of resources. The evidence from speech-therapy highlights the amount of time-on-task required to improve patients' ability to communicate. Naming problems are common and impact on the patients' wellbeing and social inclusion. There is also good evidence that current existing therapeutic approaches work.

A Cochrane review of 39 RCT's involving 2518 participants concluded that speech-therapy results in significant benefits to patients' functional communication. Many of these studies involve high doses of therapy. A meta-analysis examining dose found that positive therapy studies averaged 98 hours of speech therapy in total, while negative studies averaged 43. In the NHS a patient with aphasia can expect a total average of 6-10 hours of SALT. When the intervention takes place or how intensely seems less relevant to recovery. Our solution to the lack of available SALT therapy is to produce digital neuro-interventions that give patients the opportunity to practice scientifically validated, impairment based therapy when and where it suits them which gives them access to optimum therapy dose.

Recent improvements in acute stroke care means that demand for already limited NHS resources will increase. Commissioners will need to address this growing unmet need and innovative relatively cheap interventions like this one will provide necessary rehabilitation.

Therapy can be effortful for patients who can sometimes be too fatigued when the therapist comes to do their session. This digital neuro-intervention will provide optimum availability of therapy and therefore place the patient in control of how much they do. The investigators aim to combat this by creating an engaging and adaptive therapy. The adaptiveness will serve to reward the patients for their efforts without ever making them feel like they are failing. This will hopefully boost how long they spend in therapy and therefore make greater gains.

There are therapy 'apps"" available for patients with aphasia but the scientific basis for them is lacking and none are targeted for speech production. By using voice recognition software our intervention will be uniquely designed to be used by patients with word retrieval impairments.

What new information will the research provide? The concept of the therapy component is based on standard SALT practice and thus has a strong proof of concept basis, as do our proposed outcome measures. The novel component is packaging it in a user- friendly web-app that is designed for and by people with word-retrieval problems. This is ambitious and yet realistic goal to provide a world-wide evidence-based therapy that can benefit many. This digital neuro-intervention will be in contrast to the plethora of apps available online claiming cognitive training without having scientific proof.

The iTALKbetter research study is a small-scale, randomised, clinical trial for participants with word retrieval impairments post-stroke. The main research question is whether iTALKbetter improves patients' naming ability for trained items. This hypothesis is tested by assessing participants naming abilities on two matched lists of items, half are trained items and half are untrained. A secondary question is whether it matters how the software progresses patients through the therapy. This hypothesis is tested by creating two different versions of iTALKbetter: 'deterministic' and 'reactive'. Participants will be randomised (using minimisastion) to one of two of these versions of the therapy. Participants practice with the therapy for set periods of time (therapy block) following a series of (three) baseline measures split over a single, pre-therapy block (see Trial design section 5). The main outcome measure will be a clinically relevant improvement on the naming ability of the trained items (compared to untrained control items). Secondary outcomes include investigating which therapy version optimises recovery on naming accuracy and also improvements in social activity and participation and participant and/or carer reported outcome measures (PROMS).

The investigators also plan to capture brain-based data (structural MRI) in order to test a series of secondary hypotheses relating to both how and why the therapy may work in some participants but not others. All brain imaging will be outside of standard care for the participants and take place at UCL by trained staff.

Hypotheses and Objectives H1-Primary: Does iTB improve naming performance on trained items?

This is a within-subject comparison. The criteria for success is a 10% (raw, or unstandardized) relative improvement in performance. This effect size was used in the recent Big Cactus study.

H2-Secondary: Does reactive iTB significantly improve performance compared with deterministic iTB?

This is two factor analysis with both a within-subject factor (trained vs. untrained items) and a between-group factor (reactive iTB vs. deterministic iTB). The criteria for success is a 5% (raw, or unstandardized) relative difference in performance. This is half the effect size used in the recent Big Cactus study, but that was to compare therapy with no therapy, here expected gains may be more marginal as both groups are receiving the therapy items, just in different orders.

Primary Objective: Does iTB improve naming performance on trained items?

Secondary Objective(s):

The investigators believe that using this DNI will improve word retrieval on trained items by providing a known therapy used by SLT's through a digital app and by enabling an increased dose of therapy. However, another objective is that by using this DNI and practicing every day, there will be changes in participants' brain structure and in the health of the participants and their carers.

Does reactive iTB significantly improve performance compared with deterministic iTB?
Are the therapy effects item-specific or do is there generalization to untrained items?
Are the effects of the DNI therapy limited to the language domain alone or do they improve in other cognitive domains (e.g. sustained attention)?
Does the DNI improve participant's social activity and participation?
Is the DNI acceptable to participants (can they use it easily)?
Is the DNI acceptable to participants' carers?
Does the DNI improve carer health/well-being?
Does the DNI have any economic benefits?
Can baseline structural brain imaging explain participants' responses to the DNI?
Can baseline structural brain imaging be used to predict incoming participants' response to the DNI?
Can repeated-measures structural brain imaging identify participants' brain areas that change in response to the DNI?","Anomia Word Retrieval Digital Therapy","Interventional","Inclusion Criteria:
