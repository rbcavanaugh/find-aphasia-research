"1",5,"Adapting Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for Stroke Survivors With Aphasia","Stroke Aphasia","October 1, 2021","NCT04984239","University of Pittsburgh","Recruiting","The proposed study is a Stage I successive cohort trial intended to adapt Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) to meet the specific needs of stroke survivors with aphasia (""ACT for Aphasia""). It will do so by incorporating communication supports and compensatory speech-language treatment. The goal of developing this integrated treatment is to improve successful communication participation, psychosocial adjustment, and quality of life for stroke survivors with aphasia.

In the first phase of the project, the investigators will create a treatment manual with input from a stakeholder advisory board consisting of caregivers and stroke survivors with aphasia. The investigators will then recruit an initial cohort of five stroke survivors with aphasia to undergo the initial version of the treatment based and provide feedback. This will aid revision of the manual, which the investigators will then evaluate using a second cohort of 16 stroke survivors with aphasia. The investigators predict that ACT for Aphasia will be acceptable and feasible based on measures of participant satisfaction and treatment adherence. The investigators will also measure pre- to post-treatment changes in psychological distress, functional disability, quality of life, and communication participation and functioning to establish preliminary effect size estimates for this intervention, in preparation for a subsequent Stage II efficacy trial.","The overarching goals of this research are to improve psychosocial adjustment, quality of life, and successful communication participation by developing Act for Aphasia, a patient-centered, manualized behavioral intervention in Stage I research. Stroke survivors with aphasia in their first year post stroke will complete a 10-session intervention. In study Aim 1, the investigators will engage a Stakeholder Advisory Board (SAB) of people with aphasia (PWA) and caregivers to provide input to develop a treatment manual. The investigators will then use an iterative design process and two successive participant cohorts to refine the manual. Cohort 1 (N=5) will participate in the initial version of the treatment, then help inform its revision by being invited to join the SAB. Cohort 2 (N=16) will participate in the revised version. In Aim 2a the investigators will establish feasibility and acceptability of this intervention. In Aim 2b the investigators will estimate preliminary effect sizes for a subsequent Stage II efficacy trial.

Participant assignment: given the early phase of this research and the lack of control conditions or groups, there will be no random assignment. Participants will be enrolled in the study as they are referred and found to be eligible, with the first five participants being enrolled in the first study cohort during year 1 while the remainder of participants will be enrolled in the second cohort across years 1 and 2.

Intervention description: the ACT for Aphasia treatment manual will be a 10-session intervention created by modifying an existing ACT manual provided by Dr. Meyer. To meet the specific needs of stroke survivors with aphasia, ACT will be modified in two main ways. First, the intervention will include modified language and communication supports to address the unique communication challenges faced by people with aphasia that could impede engagement with ACT content. Multi-modality communication supports will be provided by the treating clinician (e.g., writing out key words to support verbal content, summarizing and providing repetitions, providing session summaries to review between sessions). Manual creation will follow existing practice recommendations for modifying counseling interventions for PWA (e.g., simplifying language and increasing use of visual metaphors) which will be reviewed by the SAB. Second, ACT will be further augmented via individualized language compensation training and a focus on identifying and addressing communication-based barriers to life participation. Language training will focus on active compensatory strategies such as self-cuing, use of alternative modalities (gesture, writing), and use of commonly available technology (e.g., smartphone dictionaries, text-to-speech). The details of this language compensation training will also be determined based on input from the SAB, and will be revised after reviewing performance and interview feedback from each successive cohort.

Intervention administration procedures: all aspects of the treatment protocol will be administered by Dr. Evans or a licensed speech-language pathologist on study staff who has received training in providing ACT. The intervention will consist of 10 weekly treatment sessions. Post-treatment interviews providing feedback for protocol revision will be administered by Dr. Evans within 2 weeks of study completion. Interviews will use a semi-structured, ethnographic interview approach and be video-recorded. These interviews will ask specific questions about the participant's experience and perspective regarding each functional domain of the intervention (i.e., the ""Open Up,"" ""Be Present,"" and ""Do What Matters"" components of ACT and the individualized language compensation training), and will be asked for suggestions and improvements about the specific content and techniques employed.","Counseling Therapeutics","Interventional","Inclusion Criteria:

There are a few important reasons underlying this discrepancy. For example, considerable emphasis is placed on acute and subacute stroke recovery with less therapy focus on the chronic period, when recovery is usually slower. Also, access to rehabilitation services can be limited by the availability of providers (e.g., in rural regions) or by difficulties with transportation logistics related to disabilities and the physical sequelae of stroke. One way to increase access to aphasia therapy is to rely on telerehabilitation (a.k.a., aphasia remote therapy; ART).

Word-finding in conversation is a universal and persistent difficulty in aphasia. While several techniques exist to improve word-finding in aphasia, it is unclear how the brain changes in response to behavioral therapy. In this study, persons with aphasia will receive behavioral therapy aimed at helping them to be more successful at finding words. Twenty therapy sessions will be provided in a 10-week period. Each therapy session will last about 2 hours and will include a variety of language tasks. Prior to beginning word-finding therapy, each participant will receive two fMRI scans, spaced 10 weeks apart. After finishing therapy, each participant will receive two additional fMRI scans, spaced 10 weeks apart. For a portion of the MRI scan, participants will complete language tasks. The purpose of these fMRI scans is to measure brain changes that may occur due to successful behavioral therapy. The hypotheses are as follows: First, that the behavioral therapy will improve word-finding as it has been shown to do in the past. Second, that the brain will change in a couple of different ways. It is expected that the network of regions that support word-finding will be more connected and work together more efficiently after therapy.

"12",19,"Semantic Feature Analysis Treatment for Aphasia","Aphasia","February 24, 2020","NCT04215952","VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System","Recruiting","This randomized controlled comparative effectiveness study examines manipulation of a key component of an established and efficacious treatment for naming impairments in aphasia, along with cognitive and brain correlates of treatment success. Study participants will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment conditions comparing two different versions of Semantic Feature Analysis treatment. Their performance on standardized and study-specific measures will be used to determine which version of the treatment provides superior outcomes, and measures of automatic language processing and functional brain imaging will also be used to identify the underlying neurocognitive mechanisms associated with positive treatment response.","This randomized comparative effectiveness trial examines whether active manipulation of a key component of semantic feature analysis (SFA) treatment for word-finding difficulty in aphasia improves outcomes. 40 study participants will be recruited and randomized to receive one of the two versions of the treatment. The total treatment time will be equated in the two conditions.

Study participants will be housed locally at the Pittsburgh site at no cost and will be eligible to receive reimbursement for travel expenses. During the five-week treatment phase of the study, participants will receive 60 hours of SFA treatment with pre- and post-treatment assessment of their ability to name pictures of treated and untreated, semantically related nouns. Other secondary outcomes, including measures of connected speech and patient-reported communication ability will also be collected. In order to address unresolved questions about the underlying cognitive and neural mechanisms of SFA, participants will also receive concurrent pre- and post-treatment assessment of automatic word processing ability using eye-tracking methods and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Participants will also be asked to return to Pittsburgh for two days approximately 2-3 months later for follow-up language, eye-tracking, and fMRI testing.

The language testing results will be used to determine which version of SFA treatment optimizes outcomes. The eye-tracking results will be used to infer whether SFA's positive effects can be attributed to improved activation of lexical-semantic representations, improved ability to inhibit competing representations, or both. The fMRI results will be used to identify the brain networks and activation changes associated with changes in naming ability resulting from SFA. This study will provide theoretically and clinically relevant information about how aphasia treatment should be delivered and the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying its effects.","Anomia Semantic Feature Analysis","Interventional","Inclusion Criteria:

"13",20,"Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation and Constraint Induced Language Therapy for Chronic Aphasia","Aphasia","March 28, 2019","NCT03651700","University of Pennsylvania","Recruiting","Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) has been demonstrated to improve language function in subjects with chronic aphasia in a number of small studies, many of which did not include a control group. Although the treatment appears promising, data to date do not permit an adequate assessment of the utility of the technique. The investigators propose to study the effects of TMS combined with Constraint Induced Language Therapy (CILT) in 75 subjects with chronic aphasia. Subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to TMS with CILT or sham TMS with CILT. One Hz TMS at 90% motor threshold will be delivered to the right inferior frontal gyrus for 20 minutes in 10 sessions over 2 weeks; language therapy will be provided for one hour immediately after the conclusion of each session of TMS. Change from baseline in the Western Aphasia Battery Aphasia Quotient at 6 months after the end of TMS treatment will serve as the primary outcome measure. A secondary aim is to identify anatomic and behavioral predictors of response to treatment. Finally, a third aim is to identify the mechanism underlying the beneficial effect of the treatment using a variety of imaging techniques. Subjects who have no contraindication to the MRI will undergo fMRI imaging prior to and at 6 months after therapy. Using modern network analyses and robust machine learning techniques, the investigators will identify changes in the strengths of connections between nodes in the language network to address specific hypotheses regarding the effects of TMS and CILT on brain organization that are associated with beneficial response to treatment.","TMS is a technique by which a brief electrical current is induced in brain tissue causing a brief suppression of the excitability of the underlying tissue; the technique, which was introduced in the 1980s and has been extensively used around the world, has been shown to transiently improve or disrupt specific cognitive operations. To achieve this end, a coil is positioned against the subject's head. The delivery of a single pulse begins with the discharge of current from a capacitor into a circular or figure-of-eight coil; this electrical current generates a brief magnetic field of up to 2.2 Tesla. As the pulse of electricity has a rise time of 0.2 ms. and a duration of 1 ms., the magnetic field changes in intensity quite rapidly. Because the magnetic field passes freely through the scalp, skull, and meninges, the flux in the magnetic field induces a small electric field in the brain that transiently alters neural activity.

TMS may be delivered in a variety of ways. The investigators propose to use 1 Hz TMS; that is, TMS pulses will be delivered at a frequency of 1/second. This style of TMS is assumed to be inhibitory in that it transiently suppresses the function of the cortex under the coil. Using the figure-of-eight coil to be employed here, TMS is thought to reduce activity in approximately 1 cubic cm. of cortex. Many investigators have employed TMS with a frequency of 1 Hz for periods of 20 minutes and longer; mild behavioral deficits are often present for several minutes in these studies.

The baseline phase will consist of 3 sessions, each lasting 1-2 hours depending on the stamina of the subject. The point of the baseline testing is to characterize the subject's language function. To that end, a number of standard language and neuropsychological tasks will be administered. These include the Western Aphasia Battery, Pyramids and Palm Trees test, Figural Fluency Test, word and non-word repetition tasks, the Nicholas and Brookshire Narratives, CILT stimulus naming, and Northwestern Assessment of Verbs and Sentences. Additionally, during the baseline, subjects will undergo MRI of the brain or, if they have a contraindication to MRI, a CAT scan of the head. No contrast will be used.

In the treatment phase, there will be 10 TMS sessions over 2 consecutive weeks in which 20 minutes (1200 pulses) of 1 Hz TMS at 90% motor threshold will be delivered to the inferior pars triangularis. Each TMS treatment session will be immediately followed by a 60-90 minute session of CILT

There will be two 3-month post-treatment visits and two 6-month post-treatment visits in which the full battery of language and cognitive assessments will be repeated. Subjects who are able to undergo MRI scanning will have anatomic and fMRI scans at the first 6-month post-treatment visit.

The investigators will pair TMS with CILT which has been shown to have positive outcomes in post-stroke aphasia. CILT invokes use-dependent learning in communicative interactions by requiring spoken output and restricting use of alternative forms of communication, such as gestures. The investigators will use a dual card-matching task modeled after Maher et al. As in the original CILT design, the participant interacts verbally with a conversational partner (here, the speech language pathologist), in turn requesting a card of given description and complying with the partner's request. In this way, the treatment targets both production and comprehension. Moreover, as verbal targets increase in linguistic complexity across the protocol (""a ball"", ""throw a ball""; ""Do you have a ball""?), a variety of lexical and phrasal structures are targeted. Studies of CILT have reported gains on multiple language behaviors, supporting its broad engagement of the language network.","","Interventional","Inclusion Criteria:

Using a computer based speech and language therapy program, participants will practice conversational scripts that are either short or long. Participants will practice for either 2 weeks (5 days a week) or for 5 weeks (2 days a week).","Determining the optimal intensity of treatment is essential to the design and implementation of any treatment program for aphasia. Yet, treatment intensity is a complex construct and information on the variables modulating it remain ambiguous and limited. Studies reported in the neuroscience and clinical literature support the need for intensive treatment to induce long-term neuroplastic changes while the cognitive psychology literature suggests that learning is best maintained with distributed schedules. A few studies have looked at dose parameters for single word naming tasks, but there is limited evidence regarding dose parameters for treatments that focus on training the production of larger units, such as sentences or even connected discourse. One approach that is frequently used clinically and has evidence for its efficacy is script training. Little is currently known regarding the optimum dose of script training (i.e., the number of repetitions over time of each sentence within the script) that is required to promote the best outcomes.

This study investigates the effects of modulating stimulus variables, specifically stimulus practice distribution and stimulus repetition. We use a baseline script treatment that has experimental support regarding its efficacy, and that allows the manipulation of these variables. To ensure independence and fidelity, treatment is provided in a controlled computer environment (desktop and tablet). To avoid clinician-related variables such as expertise and personality factors that may influence treatment, sentences are modeled during treatment by an anthropomorphic agent with high visual speech intelligibility and affective expressions.

With regard to ""best outcomes"", generalization is the ultimate goal of any treatment approach. Therefore, the primary outcome is a generalization measure of conversation. Secondary measures address short-term acquisition, longer-term maintenance, and stimulus and response generalization for assessing gain over baseline, differential effects, and interactions. A mobile-connected wireless wearable laryngeal sensor allows tracking of talk time at home and in the community as a measure of treatment effectiveness and transfer. For privacy, it does not record audio.

Results and computational models of learning (generalization, short-term acquisition, and longer-term maintenance) will contribute new evidence to fill critical gaps in current scientific understanding regarding the effectiveness and clinical application of aphasia treatment approaches. More generally, findings will help to inform clinical practice and treatment of neurologic communication disorders; the virtual clinician guided intervention that the proposal develops has the potential to reduce costly clinician-client time otherwise required for long-term rehabilitation.","Stroke Speech and Language Therapy Speech and Language Treatment Communication Disorders Language Disorders","Interventional","Inclusion Criteria:

"20",33,"Timing of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) Combined With Speech and Language Therapy (SLT)","Aphasia","April 3, 2019","NCT03773406","Shirley Ryan AbilityLab","Recruiting","Aphasia is an acquired (typically left-hemisphere) multi-modality disturbance of language that impacts around 2 million people in the USA. Aphasia impacts language production and comprehension as well as reading and writing. The ramifications of aphasia extend beyond language impairment to negatively impacting a person's social, vocational, and recreational activities. Currently, the most effective way to treat aphasia is with speech-language therapy (SLT). However, even if SLT is intensive, persons with aphasia are left with residual language delays. Recent research suggests that pairing SLT with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) a non-invasive, safe, low-cost form of brain stimulation may aid language recovery in persons with aphasia. However, results from tDCS studies are inconclusive. The success of tDCS in combination with SLT could depend on the timing of tDCS since tDCS-induced effects depend on the neuronal state of the brain-networks at the time of the stimulation. In this study, the differential impact of tDCS before behavioral SLT (offline-before therapy), tDCS after SLT (offline-after therapy), and tDCS concurrently with SLT (online) on functional language recovery in persons with aphasia will be investigated. Sham tDCS (i.e., SLT alone) as a control group will also be included in the study. The investigators hypothesize that both offline and online tDCS will improve language functioning than sham tDCS.","tDCS Implementation:

2mA of direct current for 20 minutes will be delivered using a constant current stimulator via two electrodes in saline soaked sponges. To stimulate the left angular gyrus, a cathodal electrode inside a saline soaked sponge (5 x 3cm) will be placed over the CP5 according to the 10-20 international system for EEG electrode placement. The electrodes will be secured in position by a custom-built EEG cap that will be marked with the location for angular gyrus. The investigators will then confirm that the cathodal electrode is over the left angular through the use of neuronavigation. The ""return"" anode electrode will be placed in a saline soaked sponge (5 x 5cm) on the center of the supraorbital region.

At the beginning of the tDCS, current will slowly ram-up during the first few seconds until it reaches 2mA. The ramp-up process will acclimate the participants to tDCS-induced sensations (e.g., itching). At the end of the tDCS sessions, current will slowly ramp down in the last few seconds to 0mA. The total duration of the 2mA current will be maintained for 20 minutes. For sham stimulation, the investigators will place the electrodes in the same location as the real tDCS groups with stimulation ending after few seconds. The brief stimulation will produce tDCS-induced sensations so that participants will not be aware when the tDCS stopped delivering direct current

Speech-Language Treatment:

Standard-of-care treatment - script training will be used to provide SLT to our participants. The treatment will be delivered via a computer program, Aphasia Scripts <c2><ae>, whereby a virtual therapist interactively guides the participants through treatment steps. Scripts will be five to ten sentences and developed from common templates about topics relevant to daily life (e.g., asking questions at the grocery store, ordering in a restaurant). The advantage of using a computer program instead of a human therapist is that it removes extraneous variables associated with human therapists (e.g., different levels of encouragement) and this, together with the use of script templates, ensures treatment fidelity across participants.

Duration of an individual subject's participation in the study:

Subjects will be requested to come for baseline sessions (3 to 4 hours) before the actual experiment. The baseline assessments may be done over two visits. In the baseline session the subjects' aphasia severity will be assessed. The participants will also perform baseline tasks of language and cognition in this session. Subjects will then participate in 3 weeks of tDCS and SLT (i.e., 15 sessions). The sessions will consist of 40 minutes of SLT and 20 minutes of tDCS. Subjects will be asked to return for an assessment immediately following the end of treatment and for follow-up testing after 4 and 8 weeks. Therefore, total number of visits will be 19-23 sessions (depending on how many visits are needed for the assessments) over a period of three months.","Aphasia, tDCS, Script training, Functional language, Naming","Interventional","Inclusion Criteria:

There has been no previous randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the effect of daily SSRI in the first three months after stroke on improvement of language in people undergoing aphasia treatment. It is plausible that SSRIs, which elevate synaptic serotonin, might enhance recovery by augmenting synaptic plasticity.

The investigators propose to conduct a Phase 2 multi-center, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial of escitalopram for augmenting language intervention in subacute stroke. The investigators hypothesize that daily escitalopram for 90 days after stroke results in greater improvement (compared to placebo) in naming untrained pictures, as well as greater increase in content of picture description and greater improvement in morphosyntactic production, when combined with speech and language treatment (SALT). A second aim is to evaluate the mechanisms of language recovery in individuals who receive active medical treatment and those who receive placebo, using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) and genetic testing. The investigators hypothesize that greater improvement in language is associated with increased connectivity within the left hemisphere language network on rsfMRI in participants who receive escitalopram than in those who receive placebo, independently of improvement in depression. The investigators also hypothesize that the effects are greatest in individuals with val/val allele of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) - (consistent with previous studies showing a greater response to treatment and greater neuroplasticity in people with the val/val allele than those with one or more met alleles.","","Interventional","Inclusion Criteria:

Because all PWA have word retrieval deficits, this project will test if greater language gains can be achieved by supplementing anomia intervention with excitatory brain stimulation to the left hemisphere and will evaluate associated functional brain changes to aid the optimization of neural reorganization to facilitate language processing.","Aphasia is a language impairment that commonly occurs following brain damage (e.g., stroke). While language rehabilitation can yield improved language functioning, treatment outcomes vary greatly across individuals. In chronic aphasia, language gains occur through the brain's inherent ability to reorganize (i.e., neuroplasticity).

While Speech-language therapy (SLT) can target various language skills and modalities, the most pervasive deficit across all persons with aphasia (PWA) is difficulty with word finding. Thus, aphasia treatment often includes some form of intervention focused on improving naming abilities. As with language function in general, naming abilities in PWA seems to be associated with left hemisphere recruitment, particularly with the viable tissue at the rim of the lesion (perilesional areas). This project investigates an innovative approach to improving current therapy by examining the benefits of using excitatory transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) stimulation/neuromodulation during anomia treatment (i.e. word-finding treatment).

Aim 1. To investigate the benefits of using broad transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to improve word retrieval in persons with aphasia (PWA). Aim 2. To study functional brain changes related to this treatment. Aim 3. To examine behavioral and neural re-organization correlates related to treatment outcomes.

Approximately 180,000 new cases of aphasia are identified per year, and approximately 1 million or 1 in 250 are living with aphasia in the United States (NIH-NIDCD, 2015). Treatments are limited and provide modest benefits at best. The current emphasis in aphasia rehabilitation is to formulate intensive speech and language therapies and augment therapeutic benefits by providing brain stimulation concurrent with therapies. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is one of the most widely used such technique. While tDCS has had relative success in chronic aphasia (>6 months after stroke), it has not been efficacious during subacute stages (<3 months after stroke). But enhancing language recovery early after stroke is desirable because of its potential impact on long-term language outcomes and quality-of-life.

The current study will investigate the efficacy of high-definition tACS (HD-tACS) to help restore neural oscillatory activity in aphasia. TACS differs from tDCS in that sinusoidal, alternating currents are delivered rather than constant currents. TACS can manipulate the ongoing oscillatory neuronal activity and potentially increase functional synchronization (or connectivity) between targeted areas. This feature of tACS is quite attractive, given the new body of evidence suggesting that language impairments stem from diminished functional connectivity and disruptions in the language network due to stroke. The selection of tACS frequencies in this study is guided by our preliminary work examining pathological neural oscillations found near stroke-lesioned areas (or perilesional) in aphasia. By exogenously tuning the perilesional oscillations with tACS, the investigators hope to up-regulate communication across these areas and other connected areas to improve language outcome. If successful, tACS will be a powerful and novel treatment approach with reverberating positive impact on long-term recovery.

The study will employ HD-tACS in a within-subject and sham-controlled design, using two frequencies (alpha/10 Hz and low-gamma/40 Hz) combined with language tasks and electroencephalography (EEG) to evaluate subsequent behavioral and neurophysiological changes. Investigators plan to recruit 50 participants: 25 stroke survivors with aphasia at lease 1 month after stroke, and 25 healthy controls.

Participants will complete language testing that covers a broad range of language functions, medical history, and MRI. Eligible participants will undergo active tACS at 10 Hz or 40 Hz, or sham-tACS. All participants will receive all three stimulation types during separate visits. The tACS administrator and participants will be blinded to the stimulation type. The order of stimulation type will be counterbalanced across participants. Washout period between visits will be at least 48 hours to minimize potential carryover effects. EEG will be acquired before and after tACS during periods of rest (resting-state) and during language tasks. Participants will complete a questionnaire at the end of stimulation visits to assess potential side effects of tACS. Total time enrolled in the study is expected to be 2-3 weeks, which may be longer depending on participant's availability.","language language impairment transcranial alternating current stimulation tACS","Interventional","Inclusion Criteria:

Aphasia treatments include speech and language therapy and pharmacologic therapy, but several studies have found that these treatments are not completely effective for patients with aphasia, leaving them with residual deficits that significantly add to the cost of stroke-related care. Additionally, the amount and frequency of speech and language therapy delivered may have a critical effect on recovery. Therefore, there is a need for new treatments or adjuncts to existing treatments, such as brain stimulation interventions, that have the potential to show greater improvements in patients with aphasia.

Stroke-induced aphasia results in increased healthcare costs and decreased quality of life. As the population of Veterans continues to age, there will be an increasing number for Veterans living with the aphasia and its consequences. Those Veterans deserve to receive aphasia treatment designed to facilitate the best possible outcomes. In the proposed study, the investigators will investigate optimal treatment intensity and predictors of treatment response for a novel word retrieval treatment. The knowledge the investigators gain will have direct implications for the selecting the right treatment approach for the right Veteran.","Difficulty retrieving words is one of the most common language complaints in individuals with stroke-induced aphasia. The negative consequences related to word retrieval impairment include increased health care costs and decreased quality of life. A variety of treatment approaches exist to improve word retrieval, and most of the treatments result in immediate improvement on trained words. However, long-term improvement and improvement on untrained words or behaviors is less common. Additionally, the investigators currently know very little about optimal treatment administration parameters, and the investigators know even less about predictors of treatment response. To make the best use of the limited clinical resources available for aphasia treatment, and to maximize outcomes for Veterans with aphasia, the investigators must: 1) develop clinically translatable treatments that yield widespread and lasting effects and 2) develop clinically accessible ways of identifying who will acquire benefit from a specific treatment approach.

Each stroke survivor has a unique pattern of strengths and weaknesses in communication and cognition, and a unique course of recovery. The BUILD study aims to understand the brain basis of these individual differences in stroke outcome. Participants with stroke as well as controls matched in age, educational background, race, and sex are examined using a combination of standardized and in-house tests of language and cognition to provide a detailed profile of strengths and weaknesses. Each participant will have between three and six sessions, including an MRI to measure details of the structure, function, and connections in the brain. The data are analyzed to test how patterns in the stroke lesion explain the patterns of communication and cognitive difficulties, and how patterns in the uninjured parts of the brain explain resilience and recovery from the stroke.

Spatial-motor-sensory problems limit functioning and independence, which is costly to Veterans, their families, and society. Currently, spatial-motor-sensory problems are targeted using different treatments. However, there is a treatment that has shown promise in simultaneously targeting spatial function, motor function and pain in right-brain stroke. The investigators propose to investigate the feasibility of using adapted spatial-motor sensory assessment and treatment procedures for Veterans with left-brain stroke who have language and cognitive impairment. The next step will be to conduct a large-scale study focused on this multi-target treatment for more efficient and effective stroke rehabilitation. The investigators expect this line of research to increase functioning, independence and quality of life in Veteran stroke survivors.","The functional disability experienced by Veterans after stroke, and the limited rehabilitation resources available, highlight the importance of identifying feasible treatments acting on more than one recovery target. Currently, there are separate and modality-specific treatment pathways for cognitive and motor impairments. These modality-specific treatment pathways lead to fragmentation of care, and under-identification and under-treatment of invisible disabilities, such as spatial neglect, aphasia and pain. The result is longer hospital stays, greater risk of falls, and poor functional outcomes. Employing a treatment that simultaneously addresses multiple targets will ensure that the investigators provide the needed care for >50% of post-stroke Veterans who have both visible and invisible disabilities, during the critical post-acute period of recovery.

Prism adaptation treatment (PAT) is a 10-day regimen reported to be inexpensive, replicable and effective for treatment of spatial neglect, and studies have demonstrated that it also enhances everyday activities and motor recovery and reduces chronic post-stroke pain in patients with right brain stroke. Additionally, brain mapping methods have shown that in patients with right brain stroke, those with frontal lesions respond optimally to PAT. No studies have investigated PAT in left-brain stroke patients with language and cognitive impairment. To address this research gap, the investigators will address the following aims:

Aim 1: To demonstrate the feasibility of adapted PAT procedures in patients with aphasia and memory impairment. .

Aim 2: To demonstrate the feasibility of adapted methods for assessing spatial and motor function and pain in patients with aphasia and memory impairment.

Aim 3: To demonstrate the feasibility of using information about lesion location from the radiology report to classify frontal vs. nonfrontal lesions.","aphasia spatial neglect rehabilitation","Interventional","Inclusion Criteria:

"37",95,"Longitudinal Imaging of Microglial Activation in Different Clinical Variants of Alzheimer's Disease","Alzheimer Disease","November 17, 2020","NCT04576793","Columbia University","Recruiting","The purpose of this study is to determine how inflammation is related to other changes in the brain that occur during the progression of Alzheimer's disease. The investigators are also studying how inflammation is related to the symptoms that first occur in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). For this reason, the investigators are asking people with different versions of Alzheimer's disease to participate. This includes patients with either:

Posterior cortical atrophy - a version of Alzheimer's disease with vision difficulties
Logopenic variant primary progressive aphasia - a version of Alzheimer's disease with language difficulties
Amnestic Alzheimer's disease - a ""typical"" version of Alzheimer's disease with memory difficulties
The investigators are also enrolling older adults with normal visual, language, and memory function.","This study is being done to learn about inflammation in Alzheimer's disease so that the investigators can find out new ways to treat patients with this disease. Because Alzheimer's disease usually causes slow changes to the brain over time, in this study the investigators are going to perform different tests and then repeat some of them two years later.

Inflammation can be measured using a type of brain scan called a positron emission tomography (PET) scan. A PET scan uses very small amounts of a radioactive drug that is injected into a vein to create a special picture of the brain. The inflammation PET scan uses a drug called ER176. ER176 is an experimental drug but has been used in several human studies before. Once in the body, ER176 sticks to areas with lots of inflammation, and the PET scan allows us to see these areas.

Inflammation can also be measured by looking at certain proteins in the spinal fluid. In order to measure these proteins in the spinal fluid, the investigators need to perform a lumbar puncture (spinal tap). Certain genes that inherited from parents influence the amount of inflammation in the body. The investigators can study how genes affect inflammation in Alzheimer's disease by looking doing genetic tests on blood that collected from the vein.

The investigators can study how genes affect inflammation in Alzheimer's disease by doing genetic tests on blood. The investigators will also be testing blood for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)- CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) antibodies. The investigators want to see if exposure to the virus that causes COVID-19 changes the amount of inflammation in the brain or not.

Along with inflammation, Alzheimer's disease is also associated with the build up of the proteins amyloid and tau in the brain. The investigators can measure these proteins using PET scans. The amyloid PET scan uses a drug called florbetaben that has been approved by the FDA to help diagnose Alzheimer's disease. The tau PET scan uses a drug called MK-6240. Like ER176, MK-6240 is experimental but has been used in several human studies before.

A brain MRI creates a high resolution picture of the brain. The brain MRI helps the investigators get more information from the PET scans, and can also tell the investigators the size and appearance of different brain structures. When someone has Alzheimer's disease, some of these brain structures get smaller or have altered appearance on MRI.","Inflammation PET scans Cognitive Impairment Posterior Cortical Atrophy Logopenic Variant Primary Progressive Aphasia Amnestic Alzheimer's Disease MK-6240","Interventional","Inclusion Criteria:
