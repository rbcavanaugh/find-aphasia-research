Repository for [aphasiaresearch.org](aphasiaresearch.org). 

Fhis website was built primarily using data from the [*clinicaltrials.gov*](https://clinicaltrials.gov/) API to identify studies that included a keyword or condition listing of Aphasia (excluding primary progressive aphasia and other dementias.) 

To add your study to this website, [submit the study](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/manage-recs) to *clinicaltrials.gov*. This has [a number of benefits for the research community and general public](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/manage-recs/background). While submission to *clinicaltrials.gov* is required for funded clinical trials in the US, voluntary submission is also permitted for other studies.

If submitting your study to clinicaltrials.gov is not feasible or is overly burdensome, you can add an IRB-approved flyer to the website by [submitting a new issue on github.com]( https://github.com/rbcavanaugh/find-aphasia-research/issues). Note that you will will need to create a github account. This is free and helps me keep track of submissions.

If you notice an error on the website, please [contact me](https://robcavanaugh.com) or [file an issue here]( https://github.com/rbcavanaugh/find-aphasia-research/issues). 

Please contact me if you would like to add the following information to your study:

- Whether or not your study can be completed remotely or long-distance travel costs are reimbursed
- A youtube link to an aphasia-friendly recruiting video to your study's information card (IRB-approved if required).
